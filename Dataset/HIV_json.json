Two nights later, I had chill and sweating on the face. My throat is really dry, though no sore throat, only a little dry cough. I went to my doctor and complained. He gave me augmentine antibiotics. After another week, I noticed rashes on my laps and tiny reddish-like colouration on my chest whenever I finished taking my bath, then scratchings on both my palms and under my feet. I also noticed that I have achings from my waist down my legs. I went to my doctor and complained. I also told him about my flatulent stomach which has lasted almost two years now, and a back pain also lasting up to two yars. He said they were not anything to panic about. But I told him about the sex six months ago, requesting an HIV test. But instead, I saw something like cadiovascular risk, urine, glucose written on the paper. No HIV. Today is the second day since I visited my doctor. And rightnow, I see that the right part of my knees is slightly swollen from the back, a little painful.

This was after I started to worry about having contracted something. I had some urinary difficulties that my GP felt were probably a UTI, and I was treated with Cipro. The current difficulty is that I started to focus on my penile area when I first began to sorry about it. Since then, I have noticed an almost constant tinglingburning in my penis this has been over a period of probably 6-8 weeks. It seems to affect the end of the penis and the underside. There are no lesions.sores to be seen. It seems not to be there when I wake up, but worsens as the day goes on. I also seem to feel a tingling in the sole of my left foot.

        "instruction": "Hello Doctors, so this past year I had one 1 random fling in late June but we only had unprotected oral sex and 2 recurring sexual partners which we did not use protection, because we knew somewhat about each other and they had a pretty monogamous past. The first of the two started getting sexual around mid-July and the second one started getting sexual around mid-October. I ve been to Planned Parenthood twice this year for the usual STDSTI examination for HIV, Chlamydia, Gonorrhea and they all came back negative. I waited at least 6 weeks after my last physical experience with the last woman to get tested before my new partner and I began our relationship. My second visit to Planned Parenthood was due to noticing some red bumps on the Glans penis area. I was afraid it was something more, especially after self diagnosing and driving myself crazy, or I figured it was probably a yeast infection since I m uncircumcised and I wasn t washing myself very well or blood vessels bursting due to sexual intercourse numerous times out of the day but the FNP said that it looked like a possible yeast infection or maybe even an allergic reaction to my partners Copper IUD.  After applying some anti fungal cream i believe it was terconazole.  the red bumps pretty much went away. We stopped seeing each other and its been about 2 weeks since I last saw her. However, now I noticed a red bump under my shaft.  It doesn t hurt, I have no pain or burning when I urinate less of course if I haven t been drinking enough water, I have no discharge or pus, doesn t look like a blister or any noticeable symptoms of anything to really worry me until I saw this thing I thought it might just be a hair follicle or something.  I did take a picture of it. I m trying not to worry but obviously its scaring me. Please help Where do I go from here.  Thank you in advance",

The itch and fungus would go away normally in a week. While its not advisable on my earlier bouts I have also used hand cleaners or gels to clean the area during shower as a an added measure which fortunately have never sparked Any form of skin allergy. However I noticed this year on my first bout , happened in April and I saw the same doctor my penile skin started peeling in thin layers  white in nature  that would seem to roll off the surface as you rub and clean it to expose a shinier new skin under. This happens on the forehead as well as the foreskin adjoining it. Tis has never happened.

        "output": "DearWe understand your concernsI went through your details. Semen is supposed to smell like chlorine and bleach. Semen contains ammonia and other sterile-smelling alkaloids and this is the reason why it smells like your store-bough cleanser. However, your semen may smell differently on different occasions as well. The smell of your ejaculate may also vary depending on other factors such as your overall health and medications. Men also sometimes find that their semen tends to smell strongly when they have not ejaculated for a long time. It also seems to depend on the quantity of the semen released during an orgasm. Poor personal hygene can result in foul smelling semen. The fish-like smell is an indication that a lot of smegma can be heaping up just under the penis head. Daily cleaning helps a lot. Foul smells are usually associated with infections of the prostrate gland or other organs of the male reproductive system. If the smell is accompanied with a change in color of the ejaculate to red, brown, yellow or green, you definitely have an infection. It is time to consult a physician and get a diagnosis done.If you require more of my help in this aspect, please use this URL.  Make sure that you include every minute details possible.

And internal diseases like DM,HIV and other should be ruled out.I would suggest to take antifungal tab like ketoconazole twice a day for two weeks along with antibiotics like cefixime 200 mg twice a day for 5 days to eradicate secondary bactetial infection. Apply antifungal cream like clotrimazole and have Sitz bath in dettol water for 10 min. daily at bath.I hope this would help you.Thanks.Dr. Ilyas Patel MD"

        "output": "Dear Patient, Thank you very much for your question. As you mentioned, during oral sex glans penis due to its high sensitivity can be easily irritated by friction. However, it is hard to diagnose without examine a patient. Some infections can cause inflammation of the head of the penis or balanitis that may cause pain and a foul discharge. My advice is to see a doctor soon. Also try to be responsible for your sexual health. Abstain from unprotected sex and limit your sexual activities to one partner who has tested free for sexually transmitted diseases. Do not think that oral sex is disease free. Oral sex can transmit infections like Clamydia, gonorrhoea and even HIV with a negligible risk. Therefore, an unprotected oral sex is not 100 disease free and it still poses a risk of contracting an STD. If you have any other questions, please let me know. I hope that I answered your question.Good LuckDr. Dinesh Nuwan Weerasinghe. MD"

It s an on and off thing. On August 26, i had sex with my significant other in the morning using a vibrating rubber ring around my penile shaft, which felt alittle tight. The very next day, I woke up with a dime size looking painless bruise or rash. It has almost dissappeared by August 28th 3 days later I m not sure what I m experiencing.. I m worried. I had ask the previous woman I ve had sexual contact with if she has anything, and she said the last partner she had sexual intercourse with was 6 months ago and she has no symptoms and have not tested for any std. So yesterday, I went to see a Doctor and he wasn t able to tell me anything. He said the bruise was probably from using the ring, and that there s no bacteria in my urine. I ve just tested for chlamydia, Gono, herpes 1 & 2, syphillis and HIV..I ve been stressing, because the burning sensation still remains, the bruise is almost gone and I ve been having slight testicle tenderness, although not too noticeable.

        "output": "Welcome to Healthapp . I have gone through your query. Your problem can be due to fungal infection. But as you had unprotected sex it is better to rule out STD like genital herpes , chlamydia , gonorrhoea, syphilis and HIV. A consultation with a dermatovenerologist is well appreciated. If you send a picture of your rash i can comment on it more. For fungal infection i usually advice antifungal ointments like clotrimazole or terbinafine for local application. Hope this may help you. Let me know if anything not clear. Thanks."

        "output": "Thanks for asking in HealthApp forumIn short Mucosal erosion may have caused this.Explanation Getting redness within 30 min of unprotected intercourse with any one is not infection. As per my opinion it is the mucosal erosion for having sex without lubrication or having sex when both are dry. So, abstain from sexual activity for now and visit a doctor to get yourself examined for your lesion and for HIVSTD as you had unprotected sex with a prostitute."

Were you wearing condom during anal and oral intercourse.  If yes you might me protected. But, I advice you to visit a doctor and get yourself investigated for STDHIV to releive your anxiety. Usually scrotal and penile skin will be very sensitive and alcohol over it may cause burning to tingling sensation when applied. Go and get examined. Good luck"

I am Dr Shareef answering your query.If I were your doctor, after a thorough physical examination I would advise you for the following1 Support your testes with properly fitting under garments.2 Avoid standing for prolonged period, and avoid lifting heavy weight if you do.3 Advise you for a routine blood tests like a CBC, AEC, HbsAG, HIV test and a urine routinemicroscopic examination followed by a culture and sensitivity report if need be.4 Avoid indulgence in any sexual activity if you are active sexually which would prevent further trivial trauma if any to the testes, apart from precipitating any kind of infection if present.5 Prescribe a broad spectrum antibiotic along with an anti inflammatory drug, and a proton pump inhibitor. The antibiotic could change after the report of the culture sensitivity test of urine.If your symptoms and discomfort do not subside with the above measures, then I would not hesitate to advise you for a Doppler ultrasound of your testes and an ultrasound of the abdomen if need be.

There is nothing to worry as it happens only momentarily for a minute. It might be the result of a more focused masturbation leading to greater excitement, especially if your feet are off the ground."

Gonorrhea, Chlamydia, and Syphilis through oral sex is extremely rare.Yeast infection is quite possible following a oral sex as yeast a commonly present in saliva or mouth cavity in many people.It can be easily confirmed with some investigations and can be treated with anti-fungal antibiotic creams and if necessary oral anti-fungal tablets.

        "instruction": "I m a menopausal 48 yr. old woman who has somehow suddenly become depressed. I have beeen dealing with a lot of lack of sleep and disturbed sleep. I was always a little bit of a night hawk  but only on the nights that I didn t have to get up really early in the morning. Anyways, the bottom line is for the last past whilesay the last 2mo. straight I haven t been sleeping much. I blame it on hormones but it s leaving me feeling very drained and lifeless. Their has been a lot of stress in the last few years we nearly lost our daughter 2 yrs.ago due to an almost fatal car accident. My mom underwent a major heart surgery a double by pass our home has been under major rennovations and my husband travels so a lot of the time, I have to be both parent mother and father. I still have a little one at home she s in school but she s still young . I lost my father back in 2006 but in spite of it all I ve always been really good about anything that came my way. Oh yeah I ve been dealing with abnormal noncancerous cells in my cervical area. So far so good but I m not out of the woods yet I may have to undergo a partial hysterectomy depending on the results coming up this november. I ve always been a really happy, full of life who lived her life to the fullest kind a person. I ve always taken everything in stride. I was always a very easy going type of person. Anyways it s out of character for me to be going through this whatever this is. I hope it s just a phase and I can snap out of it soon. I m not happy right now and I m trying so hard to hide my feelings because I wanted to believe that i could overcome it without anyone noticing and that I could fight this depression that i m going through. Anyways, I ended up seeing a doctor recently a wk. ago and she prescribed medication called Venlafaxine for 7 days 1 tablet daily.After the week is over, I m suppose to double my dose. Well, Ive only taken it for 2 days, and Ive been experiencing no sleep from the medication and i developed an allergic reaction  I ended up getting a severe case o hives. So now yesterday was the third day and I did not take the medication . Oh yes, I am also taking a natural, herbal formula 2x a day for my menopausal symptoms and I am allergic to penicllin so I don t know what to do. But the positive side was that I noticed how my mood and my emotional state had just changed after 2 days. I was much more happier the second day that i took Venlafaxine. I must tell you that a few years ago when I was 45, I had gone through a little slight depression so i went to see a doctor and he prescribed citalopram during the day and Zoplicone for night time and that medication really helped me overcome my depression back then. But this time I think I waited too long to seek help and I feel I m in a deeper depression more than I know. I totally almost stopped talking and I have always been such a great communicator I used to have a lot of friends but my husband is very satisfied with being by himself and he s a little bit of a loner and his job actually doesn t permit him much for socializing too tired to now that he s getting older. I loved people, and I still do but i dont feel that I have anything to offer anybody at this time I feel confused, tired, empty and lonely inside and I feel that I m sheltering myself and I feel a lot of anxiety because I know that I m not me right now The doctor that prescribed me to take Venlafaxine just recently is very young but she said she s been practicing for 7 years and I think she s qualified to help me but I m suppose to go for blood work actually this last week but I plan to go for sure after Thanks giving. I tried to get a whole of my physician today but she wasn t around. I was thinking I should talk to a Pharmasist to see if he can offer me some advice about what I should do from here. Can you give me some expert advice on how to deal with myself. Also, I d like to mention that I had a family funeral to attend today and I didn t take the medication and I could honestly say that I was very alert for driving, but at the memorial service I knew people their even my own immediate family and I didn t know how to truly connect with them. Me was their, but not the 100 me. It was my sister s husband s mother who passed away due to a long battle of cancer. She was a very courageous woman and it was very emotional for everyone and I had become very close to her also given the little bit of time that I ve known her. She was an angel in disguiseshe was a very strongminded, courageous loving,and caring beautiful person inside and out. So it was a very energy draining, emotional day today for a lot of us.Ok I would like to know if I should continue taking the medication which is Venlafaxine and is it better to take the medication early during the day, because i was taking it late in the afternoon because i was worried that i would be too sleepy and I would t be able to get through the day. What should I do .  I did not take the medication yesterday should i still take it tonight now at this time which is 900p.m my time. I really want to get some sleep I can t keep on this way I need medication to help me sleep but before I took the medication my whole system just turned around because since I couldn t sleep at night after I drove my little girl to school I found myself having to severely go back to bed and it seemed I was able to actually relax and get some sleep but it still was not a sound sleep but it was enough sleep to help me cope. Please give me your expert advice. I m very desperate for an anwer to solve this problelm. Believe me it would be very greatly appreciated if you could take the time to help me find a solution.

I have been seeing drs for a number of years with no luck they all try to suggest depression and I am not depressed. I found a new dr that ran morning ACTh and cortisol levels that lead to and Endocrine appointment. Results taken at 8amACTH Cortisol 260nmoll range 200 to 600 Endocrinologist said this was nothing to worry about but I pushed for a ACTh stim test So I had a high dose ACTH stim test and the results were only just ok Baseline-ACTH 13 range 10 to 20,Cortisol 321 normal 200 to 600 for am At 30 mins Cort 458 At 60 min Cort 508 Dr said these were ok but she said the Cort should of gone over 550. So they ran the low dose ACTH a few weeks later and I responded even better to this but extreme low ACTH Baseline ACTH At 30 mins Cort 630 At 60 mins Cort 630 no change. But during this test my hand went bluepurplecold and I got little shivers. This test was extremely stressful as they could not draw blood and I had to be jabbed several times and also screamed a few times The dr thinks my results are normal even though ACTH is too low to register a value. The dr has advised that I do not have to worry about ACTH levels if cortisol is ok Now I am stuck as that is all they will do. Any ideas folks.  I do not think it is addisons but my symptoms match, I do not know if I have pigmentation as I have very dark freckles they have yet to fade even though I am 34.I am thinking an ACTh deficiency or some kind of adrenal insufficiency. Should I be worried about these ACTH levels.  I have been cleared of diabetes and thyroid test were fine.I am thinking I pushed for the wrong tests and should of went the insulin stress test or metopirone overnight test.

Also whether there are any associated symptoms like sweating, pounding heart, frequent loose stools, weight loss or inability to gain weight despite a good diet.  If yes, then your symptoms might be due to hypersecreation of thyroid hormone. Hence you should check your thyroid status by asking doctor for T3,T4,TSH levels. After ruling out hyperthyroidism, the remaining possibility is essential tremors which is usually a benign condition. A medication by name Propranolol helps to reduce severity of these tremors. hence kindly get in touch with your primary care doctor. Hope this helps. Good luck"

        "output": "Hello, thanks for the query & I am sorry to hear all your troubles. Briefly, can you tell me what medications he is on for bipolar disorder.  considering the change in behavior from cheerful to aloof which is labelled as autistic by you this might be a new episode of depression triggered due to irregular drug compliance, stress of illness malaria or de novo. So we will need to adjust the dose of his mood stabilizer medications for prompt relief from depressive symptoms Secondly when was he diagnosed as malaria.  is there any any documented fever or other symptoms.  and whether he is receiving any treatment for same.  Considering his recent trip & return from a malaria & other infectious disease endemic area it will be a good option for a peripheral blood smear PBS to identify malaria parasite & start treatment with artesunate, lumefantrine or other appropriate group of antimalaria drug. Lastly, as some of mood stabilizer medications like divalproate sodium, carbamazepine etc. tend to react with medications resulting in change in blood drug levels your primary health care doctor should be informed about your friends medications of bipolar disorder. If you need any extra help, kindly revert back. Dont worry act promptly...good luck"

        "output": "Hi..May I know for what problem you were prescribed lorazepam & how did you ended up taking 5mg Lorazepam daily.  Generally speaking, Lorazepam is a short acting drug of benzodizepine class & gets rapidly cleared from the body in around 24 hours. Hence, sometimes it becomes difficult to wean off a patient in this case you from lorazepam particularly when he is taking moderately high doses like 5mg. One of the main strategies employed is addition of longer acting drugs like DizepamClonazepamChlordizepoxide of the benzodizepine class just enough to substitute for lorazepams actions & not causing distressing withdrawal symptoms. Under cover of these drugs, lorazepam is gradually stopped. In uncomplicated cases, usually 1-2 weeks time is enough to taper off lorazeapm & as aforementioned drugs are longer acting & self tapering thus lesser chances of addiction with them.

        "instruction": "Hello, I want to thank you for putting my inquiry on the message boards WWW.WWWW.WW and I really do appreciate the response that I received from it. I apologize for being so late with my reply to you to acknowledge that I received your answer and that it was very reassuring and helpful to me, thank you so much. I am hoping to post my second inquiry to your message boards again. I have OCDobsessive compulsive disorderand it has progressed over the years and getting worse. I do not know what causes it or why there is such a thing let alone why it happened to me.  But I check certain things in my home before I leave the house whenever I am going anywhere. I have to have some things a certain way in the cabinets in the kitchen and in my bathroom. I want the laundry to be folded just right and to be put away just so. And it takes me such a long time to get ready to go somewhere, what I mean is it interferes with my personal hygiene routine. I was not always like this and I can not even remember how I used to get ready for anything before. I have tried medication for OCD before and it made little difference plus the medicine gave me headaches. I have been told by a counselor in the recent past that there really is not any medication to treat OCD. I have problems with depression, OCD, mood swings, anxieties, fibromyalgia, sinuses, allergies and I was diagnosed with a Vitamin D deficiency during the late summer of this year. I found out the hard way that I am allergic to Vitamin D pills or capsules because unfortunately for me it caused me to break out with hives and itching. Which I am still dealing with although it is not as bad as it used to be but that is another situation and story for another time later. I had been prescribed Buspar for anxieties and unfortunately it also contributed to the itching so I could no longer take that medication either. I was hoping to write to you about the problems that I have been having and experiencing with OCD and with personal hygiene. I have a very hard time convincing myself that I am clean, I cannot take a quick shower. It is taking too long for me to shave, shower and shampoo, therefore there are days when I am not even practicing personal hygiene. Because it is taking up too much time and I have other things to do. I really do not have any place to go to on an everyday basis anyway so the only time I am getting cleaned up is for a doctor is appointment, on a day I go to the store for grocery shopping and sometimes for taking care of some errands or for a family get together. Taking a shower and washing my hair should not be such a task or a hectic chore but sadly for me it is. I really do not feel good about myself anymore, I can not convince myself that I am lathered up with soap, that I am rinsed or that I am clean. Each part of myself from head to toe that has to be washed and cleaned to me it is as if it is mandatory to really pay attention to making sure that I am not scrubbing but going over myself with a wash cloth so many times. And it is the same thing when I am washing my hair and scrubbing or scratching my head with my finger nails and making sure that I am thoroughly rinsed, also what is taking up so much time is the shaving. The shower stall that I have in my bathroom is what you would call a telephone booth. I am used to a shower stall and bathtub combined with a shower curtain so that I have room to wash and shave my underarms and my legs. That is what I always had no matter where I lived up until I moved to in 07. But when I am in the shower stall that I have where I live now I just feel like I am boxed in. I do not know how many times I have accidentally busted either one of my elbows and since then one of them in particular does not feel right when I have my elbow up on the table. I have tried so many ways to shower differently and it never works. I do not think anyone here would care to read how long it takes for me when I am in the shower. If I shave in the shower then I end up with razor burn under my arms and cutting myself whether it is my underarms or on my legs. I have sensitive skin but if I shave before I get into the shower then I do so by filling my bathroom sink with water and getting the necessary areas wet and applying shaving cream. And then I have trouble convincing myself that I am shaved, I am still feeling stubble under my arms and I would think that when a woman shaves under her arms. Well, then that part should be clean and completely hairless. And I shave my legs and I have to go over them again because shaving them just once apparently is not doing the job. These problems that I have been experiencing are a real pain and I can honestly say that I was not always like this. I do not have or more to the point can not afford an alternate method to shaving. Such as being able to afford going to a salon or a dermatologist for hair removal. Wax treatments from what I have come to know and understand are expensive and also are very painful. And I am very sensitive anyway, my dermatologist has also told me when I consulted him about this that there is no such thing as permanent hair removal. That body hair can be removed but it is only temporary and eventually it will grow back. I have been curious about the \u201cTry No No\u201d or the \u201cNo No Plus\u201d as well as the \u201cFlash \u2018n Go\u201d. I would like to know if either one of them are legitimate.  Are they genuine.  Both of them do have a payment plan to pay for them although they are both expensive with a money back guarantee. And the \u201cTry No No\u201d does get advertised a lot. I talked to my family doctor about the \u201cTry No No\u201d during one of my previous appointments with her and she said that her husband had checked a website about it and he read the reviews. She told me that the reviews stated that the \u201cTry No No\u201d does not work. But I do have to wonder what do a lot of other people think.  Does anyone here on these message boards have a different opinion about it.  I hope that someone here can or will eventually post a response, I would really appreciate it a lot if a member andor a doctor on the site could help me or at least could give me some helpful advice on what I should or could do. To make my life a little easier, I have tried counseling in fact I have been through counseling for several years. It has got to the point that I have just got sick and tired of counseling and getting up to get ready to go to a counseling session every one to two weeks or so. Talking to a friend or a counselor about my problems, worries, concerns, fears and sadness is really great and it helps but only for a short while. I apologize for going on into so much detail and for composing what turned out to be a very long message. But I felt I had no choice in order for me to explain my situation so that everyone here would understand. In hopes that I would receive a really good, positive and helpful answer to my inquiry. I hope everyone here has a good day, thank you and take care.",

I have never known him to breathe like this. He felt nauseous, and had a sharp pain behind the eyes whenever he coughed he has a small dry persistent cough for 2 years now. The next day he went to the doctor and she said he had high blood pressure 160100 both lying down and standing, he has always had low blood pressure till now, and she thinks this may be caused by the varnish he had been coating the floor with. A week later his BP had gone down to 140100. I cannot find any internet information which link a mild fever to high blood pressure. His fever has cleared up, but the high blood pressure is still there. Possible background risks may be exposure to ticks recently, a moderate drinking problem about 1.5 litres of beer daily and a family history with heart attack only 1 case, his grandmother at the age of 65 a problem with blood in the stool for twenty years now, that comes when he is stressed, and then goes again.",

In addition, one can also have physical symptoms like trembling, excessive sweating, dizziness, headache, dry mouth, palpitations, etc. However, it is to be remembered that to be diagnosed to have an anxiety disorder, symptoms should be prominent, affect your day-to-day functioning and be there for a significant period of time. Moreover, anxiety can arise due to a variety of causes and anxiety disorders are of different subtypes. Sometimes, we may experience anxiety symptoms due to a stress which we are not able to cope up with. In some persons, anxiety can also be associated with fear of having health problems or a major disease.

Also sometimes I ll have a fear or am afraid to ask something to someone, I have good patience,but if i get angry and saying something ,then my lip will shiver, Blushing on my face etc. Am making my own thoughts about what other will think of me. Because of all this I can t walk in public in a relaxed state,my mind will always be in working state.If am talking in a group who are not too close to me,then my lips will start to shiver, uncomfortable etc because during the talk my mind will be working on others like where are they focusing,are they focusing my talk,lip movement etc..are they laughing about me etc.... Am only good with my few too close friends.. because of the above problem,I only have few friends,I ll always be at my home ,I won t go out like others.. In summary i can say, I have self consciousness , fear, Blushing, anxiety, Nervousness , Panic etc.. Doc, Is there any ways to change all this .  Am very sad in medical school because of the above issues, Am very much like to perform on some topics on my class,but I ll hide from these stuffs ..",

It is only with age, experience and maturity that we get control of our anger. The very fact that you wish to control your outbursts of anger is an excellent beginning. Where there is a Will, there is certainly a Way. Whenever you feel angry, just turn away from the situation and try not to speak out. If you remain silent, the other person cannot continue to instigate you for long. Best way to control anger is through silence and not to respond to the provocations at all. By practicing silence you will soon appreciate your inner peace of mind and satisfaction, in avoiding an uncomfortable situation. Wishin you all the best."

That is all that matters. 60 of people hear voices or see things that others can not experience atleast once in their life. This is a proven fact. The only difference is that your experiences are persisting for long time and are troubling you. The best thing to do is to get professional help. It could be that the most simple thing could be the answer to your problem, like talking about stress that you are experiencing at home or at school or with friends, or stopping the occasional pot or marijuana that you may be doing or whatever. I am just guessing all the simple things that could help you with these things apart from the notion that you are going crazy. Do consult a psychiatrist. There are lots of reversible causes that may cause experiences like these. And we can help in all of them. Half the battle is already won that you are seeking help for the experiences. Goof Luck."

[check them as routine examination] .3. make sure to check with stool examination for worms, since they can be the cause of the same and take antihelminthic medication [albendazole] for the same4. Chronic dry skin conditions such as psoriasis and seborrhea along with profuse sweating are also risk factors for anal itching, evaluate and exclude the same with necessary examination.5. Scents, dyes and softening agents in products such as soap and toilet paper [wet diaper wipes] may also trigger irritation and anal itching [check for the same]6. .avoid scratching which further irritates skin and leads to persistent inflammation, apply a cold compress to the area or take a lukewarm bath for immediate relief.. Avoid wearing tight fitting garments because these can trap moisture, prefer cotton underwear and loose clothing which helps keep the area dry.. Avoid overuse of laxatives, maintain regular, firm bowel movements. add fibres or fibre supplements to your diet.. cut down on caffeine, chocolate, beer, nuts, dairy products, and spicy food.

In Ayurveda we hold that most of the itching is caused due to problems associated with \u2018Vata dosha and by pacifying the aggravated \u2018vatai.e. impurities in the Rakta blood and Stress we can bring down the signs and symptoms of itching.4.

Most coughing is due to a viral infection, which means that medicine will not solve the problem. You simply have to let it run its course. Infant cold medicines can be dangerous in a child who is only 6 months old, so you should only give them under the direction of your doctor. some natural remedies, Run a humidifier at night. A dry room can exacerbate any coughing problems that your baby may have. A cool-mist humidifier can help relieve his coughing problems. If you want, you can use a eucalyptus enhancer with the humidifier. Feed your baby on demand. When fighting off a cold, babies need extra calories to help fight the infection. Do not try to stick to a usual feeding schedule. If your baby seems hungry, feed her. Keep your baby as upright as possible. Lying down can make a coughing problem worse, as sinuses drain to the back of the throat. hope helped your query regards dr.surendiran"

However, it is not fatal and entirely treatable.The most common in this context is an immune reaction to hepatitis that causes localized collections of immune cells that cause painful localized inflammation around blood vessels vasculitis.

        "instruction": "Hello. My name is Jessica. I am a 25 year old female. I am currently almost 6 months pregnant, so my trips to different specialists have ceased for the time being. I will try and be as descriptive and brief as possible with what I have been experiencing. Ok, so in or around MarchApril of 2009, I was told that I had mild PCOS. This was due to increased levels of testosterone and a cyst on my left ovary. I started taking Ortho Tri Cyclen in May of 2009. Around this time, i started to develop chronic hiveswelts with intense itching. This was not limited to any part of my body and occured every day. Within a period of a few months, I noticed a significant amount of hair fall-out, and realized after a period of time that I probably had about a 30 decrease in the overall amount of hair on my head. I ceased taking the birth control in August of 2009. I started taking a multivitamin with a biotin supplement. This seemed to stop the high amount of hair fall out. But after giving it time, my hair really never recovered. The hair that grew back has been noticably thinner. It is currently July of 2010. My hair has started to fall out a little more, despite being pregnant. The hives never ceased since last year. They have been partially relieved by 5 mgs of Xyzal daily that my allergist prescribed me. Aside from the allergist, who has found no reason for the chronic urticaria, I have seen a dermatologist, and an endocrinologist. All my thyroid tests come back normal, but I m not sure if they test for thyroid antibodies. My dermatologist suggested by feeling my throat, that my thyroid was slightly larger than normal, but after looking at my thyroid blood labs from other physicians, did not follow up with that. My endocrinologist stated that my histamine levels were abnormally high, and that my testosterone was high, but only wanted to help by prescribing me Metformin, which I chose not to take, due to the fact that my blood sugar tests have always been completely normal. The PCOS has made it difficult to lose weight, but with a healthy diet and exercise, I maintain weight. Even though my testosterone levels were high in blood work from last year, my testosterone levels were always a little elevated, and without the urticaria or hair loss. The only other strange occurence of chronic hivesweltitching occured in 2005 when I happened to be taking Ortho tri cyclen for a year or so. About a year after starting the BCP, I went through a few months of chronic urticaria accompanied with awful acid reflux. My doctor told me I had chronic stress, but the problem subsided back then. Basically, I have seen 3 specialists and my gyno, and not one person can tell me whats causing the hives, and my hair thinning. I am completely at rock bottom. I am currently pregnant and trying not to stress, but when everyone tells you how great your hair is supposed to be while your pregnant, and when you see yours falling out, it puts a great deal of stress. The only thing that has gotten nice are my nails. My acne has gotten worse, and I have no where else to turn. Please help me with any suggestions. Is it my thyroid.  My hormones.  This has been going on so long and I can t take one more person just trying to mask it with Metformin or Spironolactone, etc etc. Thank you so much for your time, Jessica",
        "output": "Hi... I have gone through your case. My advice is post embryo transfer you should not rely on urine pregnancy test as blood levels are sometimes not enough to be detected by urine test. Rather you should do a beta HCG blood test.Constipation is more common after a IVF because you must be on progesterone supplementation for luteal support which is the reason for constipation. Need not to be worried just have plenty of liquids and green leafy vegetables."

        "output": "Thank you for your query. When a woman finds out she is pregnant, the gestational age is already 4 weeks calculated from the first date of the last menstrual period. When a miscarriage occurs, all the products of conception are expelled out along with the endometrial lining. It is like a heavy period. However, sometimes, the placental tissue remains adhered to the uterus and needs to be removed either by medications that enhance uterine contractions and if that too does not work, it has to be removed manually by a dilatation & curettage D&C. An ultrasound is performed to confirm that all the embryonic tissue is expelled. Symptoms of pregnancy - nausea, vomiting, frequent urination to name a few. In your aunt is case, she may have meant 3 months. Hope this answers your query. Please get back to us for further clarification. Wish you good health"

        "output": "Hallow Dear,Let me answer your queries one by one. 1. In fact there was no risk of pregnancy from the unprotected sex performed just 3 days after the period as it was far away from fertile period. The egg is formed 14 days prior to next period. It has life of 24 hours while sperms are active for 72 hours. Hence a period of about 8-10 days is considered as fertile period. Intercourse during this period has maximum chances of pregnancy. However, your menses being irregular, it is very difficult to locate the day of egg release. May be you could be having problem in egg release also. Still, considering your menstrual irregularity, you have taken a wise step in taking Postinor 2 after the unprotected intercourse. Postinor 2 is quite effective post coital emergency contraceptive pill if taken within 72 hours of unprotected sex. You have taken it after 10 hours. So you need not worry about pregnancy. You are well protected. 2. Your irregular menses need to be investigated thoroughly. There are many conditions that lead to menstrual irregularities. Some of them are Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome, Thyroid dysfunction, any other reproductory dysfunction, ....... it will fill your complete desk top if I start enumerating all of them. I can guide you on this issue thoroughly if you inform me your age, menstrual pattern, age of menarche first menstrual appearance, marital or sexual history. You can inform me all this by asking a Direct question. Else, you may report to the Gynaecologist. Irregular menses may result in infertility due to non-release of eggs. For the time being, you may try cyclical birth control pills for three months for regularization of menses as a preliminary step. 3. Boils around the private parts are usually due to infections may be sexually transmitted infections like gonorrhoea, herpes genitalis, etc. You need to report to STI specialist for correct diagnosis and appropriate treatment. You may need antibiotics treatment. Also you will have take care of genital hygiene and be demanding for clean sex only. I am sure this has given you some direction on your reproductory health problems. Dr. Nishikant Shrotri"

If it is above 38 degrees Celsius or 100.4 Farenheit she should call her OB provider to see if she needs to go back to the hospital.If her fever is not elevated, she may just be cold, so lots of blankets, hot tea and warm clothing will make her feel better and it may just take time for her to get over this illness.Make sure she drinks lots of liquids and also pay attention to the movements of the baby. If the baby is not moving like usual, or if she has any abdominal pain, vaginal bleeding or leakage of fluid, she should return to the hospital to be evaluated.I hope I was able to answer your question today and tha my advice was helpful.Best wishes,Dr. Brown"

        "output": "Hi there,,What you are experiencing could be preterm labor and it is essential for you to go to a Gynaecologist and get yourself checked, if you are in labour or not.It is very necessary to rule out preterm labour, especially since the pain is severe and radiating from abdomen to the thigh.Preterm birth can lead to problems for your baby and it may require NICU admission and help with breathing.Hepatitis C has nothing to do with the pain and it has a less than 20 chance to be passed on to the baby.If you have only hepatitis C infection with no infection of Hepatitis B virus then it is absolutely safe for you to go for a normal vaginal delivery.Only if have co-infections with either hepatitis B or HIV that it is necessary for you to undergo a cesarean to decrease risk of transmission of virus to baby.Inform your neonatologist about the hepatitis C infection so that appropriate care of the baby can be taken at birth.Do not neglect the pain and see a doctor immediately.Hope this helps"

If you are regularly on depo injections, then seven to ten days plus - minus will not affect your contraceptive effects of the depo shot.Also, return to fertility is not that instantly even if a woman stops taking depo shot.2  You need to wait for at least 2 weeks after unprotected sex yo get the urine pregnancy test to show the results. 3 I will suggest you to take emergency contraceptive pill like i pill or Plan B within 24 to 72 hours of unprotected sex act. This will help to prevent the pregnancy. 4 Please do not take depo injection if you are not sure of the pregnancy condition.

        "output": "Hello, and i hope I can help you today. Low white blood cells which are the disease-fighting cells in your body can occur both as a result of a disease that lowers your white cell count like HIV or by consumption when your body is working hard to clear an infection. In your case, your doctors were concerned you had an infection in your body causing your white blood cells to fall. They found the infection in your kidneys and prescribed an antibiotic, which if it works, should clear the infection and your white cell count will return to normal. Your white cell count and your having a kidney infection does not affect the baby at all as long as you are treated properly and follow your doctor is advice. My only concern is that if you truly have a kidney infection, amoxicillin is not a particularly strong antibiotic for urinary tract infections. So if you have taken the medication for a few days and you still have fever higher than 38.5 Celsius, 101f or bad flank pain occasionally IV antibiotics are needed for treatment.I hope my answer was helpful for you today and that my advice was helpful.Best wishes, Dr. Brown"

        "output": "Hello, and I hope I can help you today.Estimating your date of conception is only really possible for women who have a 28 day menstrual cycle. By convention, the computer programs that are used to calculate your due date are working from an assumption that a woman has a 28 day cycle, and that conception took place exactly 2 weeks after your last period. If your cycle is longer or shorter, your ovulation could have taken place on a different day than what is estimated.So really just depends on whether you were with your second partner during your fertile window, which really can start 7 to 10 days after the first day of your last menstrual period and continue until a week before your next menstrual period is due.So depending upon how close and timing your sexual encounter with your second partner was, will determine how likely it is for him to be the father. If the margin either way is only a matter of a few days, you really will need a DNA test to accurately predict the paternity of your child.I hope that I was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful.Best wishes for the rest of the pregnancy,Dr. Brown"

Pregnant women get much sicker from the flu than other demographics, because their large belly makes it harder to cough and their body caring for the baby drains their energy.However, your body is designed to protect the baby. And regarding your blood test, it is normal for your alkaline phosphatase to be elevated in pregnancy.But if you have not been officially diagnosed with the flu, or have not had an evaluation of the baby since you started feeling sick, I strongly suggest you go to the hospital for evaluation for you and the baby. There are other conditions that can cause shivers and fatigue during pregnancy, and if you have a fever higher than 104 or 40 Celsius it can harm the baby is hearing. So please get a full medical evaluation as soon as possible if you have not yet done so. In the meantime, you can safely take Tylenol Acetaminophen or Paracetamol at the regular adult dosage safely while pregnant.

Without any personal  age medical history  pregnancy histories , it is not possible to decide. There are n number of methods.But let me put forwards a list of methods & the the situations where they are suitable.1.Oral Contraceptive pills -- Has to be taken daily from Day 1 of periods for 21 days , give a gap of 7 days, then restart the next pack . This is ideal for those not yet delivered those can remember to take pills everyday those with irregular periods those who are not breast feeding those without any blood coagulation problems, DVT, heart problems etc2.Copper IUD - Can be inserted by gynecologist immediately after periods- Available for period of 3 yrs 5yrs10yrs.Ideal for those who want one time method, with risk to forget pills daily not at risk of pelvic infections  HIV or any STDs.3. Norplant - Subcutaneous implants - can interfere with normal ovulation & periods may reduce or stop. Cheap & has protection based on which typr you use Type 1 or 2. One time method for 5 yrs or lesser.4.Nuva ring- vaginal inserted ring of hormones- Which has to be removed every month end for periods to occur . Can give good cycle control. Not very costly .But needs removal & reinsertion of new ring every month yourself.5.Injectable hormones- Will act for 3 mths, not costly, No periods or minimal periods or only discharge. Good for breast feeding mothers, those with irregular bleeding, endometriosis adenomyosis. Occasionally cause ovarian cyst but not significant.I have given list of common methods ,the list is very long but cam be used based on your profileHope I have cleared your queryAll the bestDr.Balakrishnan"

        "output": "Hello,thanks for using Healthapp Ipill is a progesterone based medication and it is effective iin preventing pregnancy when taken within the recommended time period of less than 72 hours following intercourse.Ipill being a progesterone, has the potential of altering menstrual flow both by volume and duration. However, this is just temporally and gets regularized after a couple of cycles.Occasional in take of Ipill has no effect on fertility. However, persistent in take for years could suppress ovulation that would take a long time say up to six months and even above one year before coming back. With absence of ovulation, you will definitely be unable to get a pregnancy.Unprotected intercourse is a risk factor for sexually transmissible infections such as HIV, herpes, , hepatitis B virus and HPV which is associated with cervical cancer.Hope this helps you.Best regardsDr Achuo"

        "output": "Welcome to Healthapp .I have reviewed your query and here is my advice.If you do not have any pregnancy yet than the pain during menstruation is mostly due to spasm of cervix mouth of uterus. So, you have to take antispasmodic tablets or injection for pain relief. You can have that tablet every time in your menses. Secondly, if you both are HIV positive that does not mean you cannot conceive. Yes it is true that there is a chance of transfer to the baby. And also it is a high risk pregnancy. You just have to continue your treatment medicines and continue pregnancy also. For detail you have to consult a nearby gynecologist and may be pediatrician for chances of pregnancy, chances of transfer to baby, and other pros and cons of that. Now for your pain, Dicyclomine like Antispasmodic will do. And if it remains for long time and you do not want pregnancy at all than cervical dilatation is one option after which your pain will be very less and bearable. It is a minor operation you can ask your doctor about it. And if you are planning for pregnancy then one pregnancy happens and the problem is gone so no pain. Once delivery or abortion takes place the source of pain is also gone due to natural cervical dilatation.Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further."

Yesterday I went for a HSG test and the report says that there is irrgularity and beading , more marked distally near fimbrial end, suggestive of bilateral tubal block.All my previous reports are quite normal. Like my uterus is normal, ovaries are normal, cervical canal is normal, hormone levels are normal but still infertile. Please suggest.",
        "output": "Hallow Dear,Unless the tubes are patent, there is no chance of natural conception. However, your tubes are not just blocked, there is irregularity and beading in the tubes noted in Hysterosalpingography. This finding is highly suggestive of genital tuberculosis wherein the tubes are affected. Please get yourself investigated from a Gynaecologist for genital tuberculosis. Also look for presence of tuberculosis elsewhere in the body, particularly the lungs, by X-ray. Hysteroscopy will help to have a look at the endometrium for similar lesions. Laparoscopy will throw more light on complete pelvic health. If tuberculosis is confirmed, you will have to undergo antitubercular line of treatment. Tuberculosis can definitely be treated completely by treatment under observation however treatment of tuberculosis is a prolonged treatment and for genital tuberculosis, you may have to take the medicines for at least 9 months. Along with the treatment, healthy high protein and high calcium diet with adequate Vitamins is necessary. Fresh fruits, fresh green leafy vegetables and fresh air to breath help speedy recovery. If tubes are affected by tuberculosis, the chances of natural conception are rather poor since though by surgery the tubal patency is regained, the tubal function is damaged. So after completion of the antitubercular treatment, you may consider Artificial Reproductory Technique for conception and pregnancy. One more suggestion, as per the WHO suggestions and our experience, every case of tuberculosis should be tested for HIV since tuberculosis increases the possibility of HIV infection six fold so also HIV increases the possibility of tuberculosis six times. I feel you should concentrate first and more on getting healthy. Then later, attempts for pregnancy may be considered. Dr. Nishikant Shrotri"

        "output": "Hello dhanalakshmi, You missed your period in January and had irregular scanty less bleeding after that. If you are sexually active and you miss a period, the first diagnosis is to rule out pregnancy. If there is a pregnancy, the irregular bleeding could be because of an abnormal pregnancy - either an abortion process or a pregnancy in the tubes. The Urine Pregnancy Test is positive for pregnancy if there is a second red line. Light shade may be in either case - abortion process or pregnancy in the tube. Considering all this information, i suggest you get a Transvaginal Ultrasound tomorrow morning and consult your doctor with the reports. You must first solve this issue or whether you are pregnant if pregnant then where is this pregnancy - inside uterus or in tube. A pregnancy in the tube is a real emergency and can even take away life. You will need to visit your doctor, who will solve your problem after an examination and ultrasound report. You sound very young. You should use contraception if you do not want to get pregnant. I would suggest Oral Contraceptive Pills available easily in any chemist shop. This is very effective in PREVENTING a pregnancy but it cannot drop a pregnancy if you are pregnant just now. Abortion Pills can do that but they should be taken only under doctor is supervision otherwise there can be complications. So you should take Oral Contraceptive Pills to prevent pregnancy and your partner should use a condom EVERY time you have sex to prevent Sexually Transmitted Disease, HIV and AIDS.

        "output": "Hello, Folic acid is a B vitamin that is necessary for a healthy pregnancy. While it is possible that folic acid can boost your fertility, it is also important to begin taking it before conception for health reasons. Taking folic acid before pregnancy is important for your baby is health. It helps prevent neural tube defects such as spina bifida, which occurs when the spinal column does not close to protect the spinal cord, and anencephaly, which occurs when the brain does not develop completely. FOLIC acid creates a very healthy atmosphere in the uterus for the growing baby. Although taking folic acid can improve your chances of getting pregnant and provides important benefits for your developing baby, you should not consume more than 1,000 mcg of folic acid a day. Too much folic acid can hide signs that you are lacking vitamin B-12, which can lead to nerve damage. Minor side effects of FOLIC acid are nausea,bloating,gas etc. While rare side effects include hives,difficulty in breathing,swelling of lips,face and tongue. Thanks"

Im really unsure of what it is. Everytime i try to change my diet and the way i eat, this happens to me. Started occuring from 2008. Unfortunately i am a yo-yo dieting type and like to try out new diets. Everytime i change the way i eat, 4-5 days or a week in it appears on my chest. I feel a tingly itchy sensation in the center of my chest between my breasts... than i know its coming. The only way i know how to counteract it is immediately stopping my diet and workout regimen and going back to being sedentary and eating whatever i want. The first time dealing with this I wanted to lose weight for an upcoming wedding so i didnt let it stand in the way. This left my face badly scarred all over. I continued on and I continued to break out on my chest, face chin, and T-zone. The blothcy skin goes from blothchy under the skin and slowing rises to the surface, after a few days becomes raised-ish bumps very slightly and spread to the inside parts of my breasts. Later they form into white-head type pimples . My face itches and feels allergic almost and dry with blothchyness 2 days before the actual white heads begin to form. On my chin and between my eyebrows the whiteheads form 3 or 4 at a time and if i dont pop them they all form into one big one. First time back in 08 i didnt pop them and it eventually left my face completely scarred. I thought it was a food allergy to excessive amount of milk i was drinking the first time I went on a diet. That proved to not be the problem when i did a detox cleanse master cleanse for 9 days where I drank nothing but lemonade made with water, lemon juice, organic syrup, and cayenne pepper.

        "output": "Hivenkat, Welcome to HealthApp forum, venkat ,treatment of lip vitiligo is difficult,but not impossible.Treatment depends upon whether the patches are spreadingactive or are they stableinactive.If they are spreading then you need to stop the spread by taking oral steroids and immuno-modulators.Along with this you can take some photo sensitizers like melanocyl to give it color. Once the patches are stable say for more than 6 months ,then you can go for surgery called BLISTER ROOF GRAFTING. This is a very specialized surgery where in a blister is created on the abdomen and this thin skin is grafted over the lips ,after dermabrassion of lip skin. This gives good result .You can see details in my web site www.skinhairclinic.com.vitiligo section.

        "output": "Hello. Thanks for writing to us at HealthAppThese patches could either be Discoid dermatitis Or Fungal InfectionTinea.The distribution of the patches however goes more in favor of Discoid dermatitis rather than fungal infection.Outer thighs are a relatively common site for these patches because this area is dry Tinea is common in the inner thigh area.A KOH examination would prove to be conclusive in that regard. Topical OTC antifungals e.g clotrimazole 1 cream may be tried if KOH is positive for fungal elements.On the other hand if it is negative for fungal elements treatment would eb along lines of discoid dermatitis.Since underlying dryness is the predisposing factor in Discoid dermatitis, therefore I would suggest an OTC intensive moisturizer over the whole affected area.Specifically for the patches, I would suggest a topical potent steroid cream e.g clobetasol propionate cream, twice daily for 2-4 weeks.Topical steroids are prescription products. I would suggest that you visit a dermatologist in your region for a confirmatory diagnosis as well as appropriate prescription."

These patches are very resistant to treatment and once cleared with medicines there is always a possibility of its recurrence.There are various remedies ,best is to use a broad spectrum sunscreen daily three times .At night one can use de-pigmenting creams only on the spot. These creams either contain hydroquinone, tretinoin, steroids ,glycolic acid or kojic acid . One can even go for chemical peels from a dermatologist at regular intervals. The latest is the use of lasers ,but the results are not very promising as compared to the cost involved.

It started on my legs from what I noticed, and I thought they were just a few bug bites or maybe razor burn. But then over the next few days I began to noticed more and more itchy bumps on my arms and legs. On the front of my thighs, and tops of my forearms, back of my arms, and sides of my hips I began to get these little red clusters. They look like hives urticaria from pictures online now but don t go away. Some of the bumps have healed but I develop a few new ones almost every day. The rashes have not healed yet but do seem to be getting a little better. At first I panicked and thought we might have bed bugs but I ve searched my bed and surrounding furniture for them daily since the beginning of all this and have not found a single sign of them. I also share a bed with my husband, and our 3 children 4 years, 16 months, and 6 weeks old most nights and I am the only one with these bumps and rashes. I went to the doctor and she told me that if she were just judging by the random bumps on my legs and arms that she would think they could possibly be bed bug bites, but with the huge rash up my entire right arm, and the small ones on the left arms, both thighs, and hips, that she was 99 positive it was not bug bites, and was some kind of allergic reation. She gave me a steroid shot and cream which seemed to help a little but certainly did not clear it up. A few days later we did a blood test and I just got the results back and I have a slight milk allergy and slight wheat allergy. My question is could one of these allergies be causing this rash.  Can a slight wheat allergy cause the rash to take the form of bug bites in certain places of my body, and a very obvious rash in other places.  If I only had the rash I would not be so concerned about bug bites, but on certain parts of my body calves, knees, ankles, upper thighs, and arms where the rash has healed I just have a few random itchy bumps here and there that pop up sometimes overnight and sometimes during the day. The only thing I can describe them as are bug bites, but they all are different sizes, and generally start out skin colored and not very noticeable until I scratch and then they turn red and stay red.

After a medrol dose pack I was fine, and felt very well at about 2-3 weeks post op. Then suddenly at about 4 weeks I developed a really bad itching with swelling in my hands and feet as well as huge hives, small welts and patches of rash all over my arms, neck, chest, tops of my feet, on my face and in my ears. At one point I ended up with a swelling and burning feeling on the left side of my tongue and left tonsil. My hands and feet would end up being painful in all the joints at the worst flare ups .

Any history of outdoor activity, exposure to plants, dust, animals, chemicals, any medication , any particular food. Anything you have been allergic to in the past. Once you can narrow down the possible factor, you will have to avoid it or you will keep having similar reactions. Seeing circles and lines, either white or reddish wherever you apply pressure, or scratch, is called dermographism and is a sign of sensitivity and high allergy levels in blood. So do consult a doctor regarding tests for the blood levels of eosinophils, serum IgE etc, which can show allergy. Skin tests can also be done to check specific reactions.Very rarely this reaction can happen even in normal skin.Apply a mentholcalamine lotion for the itching, 2-3 times a day. Start an antihistamine daily for 5-7 days after consulting the dermatologist. They may advise a longer course after seeing your blood work. This can help bring the allergy levels in control.If it is severe or persistent, you may be advised a cortisone shot in the ER.Use a mild soap for washing, avoid harsh chemicals. In case you have severe swelling, puffiness of face, lips, difficulty breathing, etc go to the ER immediately.Hope this helps guide you. Try to see the doctor as soon as the rashes appear."

        "instruction": "My daughter was treated with hives last night having had a shot of predizilone and benadryl. She returned home no problem and slept great. At about 5 a.m. she woke up very irate saying she was itchy and we discovered that the skin reacting had returned and it was all over the body. What should I do to ensure that this rash does not return or should we keep treating it with benadryl.  Should we take her back to urgent care for an allergy test.",
        "output": "hello. welcome to HealthAppYour daughter seems to have developed an allergic reaction to something which she came in contact with at night. Was this the first such reaction or has she had similar allergies in the past. It is important to find out what caused the allergy, as re-exposure to it will cause the hives and itching again.Was there any contact with dust, pollen, outdoor plants, insects, pets, any possible bed bugs, mites, or new medication.  Any history of eating out, especially seafood, nuts,etc.  Did anyone else experience similar symptoms. The benadryl can be continued for a few days until the symptoms subside. prednisolone may be needed if there is a severe outbreak of rashes. In case of severe symptoms like breathlesness, puffiness of face, lips, go to the ER immediately.Apply calamine lotion over the itchy skin.These are just temporary symptomatic treatments. To prevent further attacks, the trigger cause needs to be found. If this happens often, keep a note of any possible factors, as I mentioned, that could be the trigger each time.Antihistamine needs to be continued till the symptoms subside completely, maybe 3-5 days.Visit the dermatologist if they are persistent even on treatment. Your doctor may suggest blood tests if needed. Skin tests for allergy are generally not done during an active episode of hives. A later date may be given to you.You may be referred to an allergy specialist.For now, continue treatment as advised and observe. Hope this helps."

        "output": "Hello. Thanks for writing to us at HealthAppYour description of the rash and its distribution does seems to suggest that it is Shingles it is arranged in a stripe like pattern across one half of the body, with a sharp mid line cut off.I would suggest that you visit a dermatologist for a confirmatory diagnosis. A dermatologist would be better able to confirm it or rule it out.Shingles may initially start either as red raised bumps or as raised patches and subsequently may develop fluid filled lesions. Therefore absence of fluid filled lesions from the start doesnt rule out shingles. There is usually associated pain and burning sensation.If this is confirmed to be shingles on visual inspection, treatment would be with an oral antiviral e.g acyclovir or valacyclovir.Associated pain also need to be managed appropriately because it is usually severe, specially in old age group. Treatment options for pain include Oral NSAIDs, Tricyclic antidepressants like amytriptyline, Antiepileptics like carbamzepine, gabapentin and pregabalin. First step would be to visit a dermatologist for a confirmatory diagnosis"

Firstly, i would suggest treatment of your secondary infection if any with oral and topical antibiotics.The key to successful treatment of scabies lies in treating everyone simultaneously in the family and others who are in close physical contact. Your doctor would prescribe oral drugs like ivermectin which will kill the parasite. You might also be advised application of permethrin 5 cream and a corticosteroid with fusidic acid cream. Apply the medicated creams exactly as advised by your doctor. Take antihistaminics as advised to relieve itching and irritation. Avoid sharing of clothing and toiletries and launder all you bedding and clothes in warm water.Hope this will take care of your issue.Wish you best of health.Thank youDr Hardik Pitroda"

        "output": "Hello,I can understand your concern for hives and boils on body.Urticaria is a common condition caused by bursting of allergy producing cells known as mast cells due to certain aggravating factors present in the environment. As the chemical inside them is released it produces a rash which you have mentioned. There can be multiple factors producing this condition which are included in day to day life and some times it is really difficult to find one exact cause. In your case you are correlating it with exercises, hot climate,spicy food. So it is better to stay away from the offending factors.The long term effective treatment for this is by oral anti histamine like loratadine under medical advise. It is one of the drug which is not having any side effects and can be taken for long term usage. Do not scratch or rub the skin as it can lead to further aggravation.All the best."

        "instruction": "I have been taking LisinoprilHCTZ for about six years. I was initially prescribed 40 mgday, but about three years ago the dosage was changed to 20 mgday. It seemed to be working well, until Tuesday, January 21st, about 200 PM, I noticed tiggling in both my hands after taking a shower. The tingling turned into viscous red itching hives on my hands that traveled up my forarms to my elbows. The next morning I went to the ER, where they told me that it was probably a reaction to penicillian that I was given for a throat infection. I have taken penicillin before in the past, I m a 48 year old African American female, and was suprised to hear that after having taken the medication for about nine days, I would develop an allergic reaction. I threw the last two remaining doses of penicillin away, took the prednisone medication and benydril capsules given to me and went to bed. The next morning, I noticed that my hands had swollen up painfully. The hives I had previously on my forarms had gone away, but new more numerous smaller hives were there. I also had numerous hives on my lower torso, and thighs, some small about a quarter of an inch in diameter, some huge, almost five inches in diameter My lower legs, feet, upper torso and face were completely unaffected. I took more benedyl and my second dose of prednisone and went to bed. Today I woke up with a swollen lip, dizziness, difficulty breathing, and even more vicious, numerous hives on my forearms, lower torso, and thighs. The benedryl capsules were useless and the predisone was not working. I went back to the ER where the doctor gave me benedryl intraveneously, and a stronger 6 day regime of predisone, and blamed this time the Lisinopril that I have been taking. My question is this. Why on earth would I have such severe hives and swelling now after being symptom free with Lisinopril for six years. Also, I wanted to add that I had been using a new body soap for about two weeks without any adverse reactions, and I had bought a new laundry detergent that I used for about a month without any previous adverse reactions. I have been going over my movements for the past week and can come up with absolutely no changes in eating, bathing, hygiene practices, etc. that would begin to address such a strong acute reaction.

For what exact condition you were prescribed loratadine and in what exact dose you are taking it.In general loratadine is a very safe tablet. If I were your dermatologist then would have you to increase the dose of loratadine. It can be increased from 1 tablet to 2 tablets and upto 4 tablets if the itching is not controlled. The only precaution you must follow is not to touch, pinch pop or squeeze any of them other wise it can get infected and can cause complications.Take care."

I have seen a PCP, dermatologist, and ENT specialist. Recent CBC shows 50 eosinophils, otherwise WNL. Titers are WNL. ENT consult suspected dehydration as a cause of the swelling, because I usually have associated tiredness and thirst from emotional and physical stressors being in medical school. Dermatologist suspects viral exanthem or drug allergy. I noticed hives related to cold for the past 2 years, however the parotid swelling is new this year. What do you think I may have.  I feel my condition is probably chronic, virally related, triggered by stressdehydration.",
        "output": "Hello and welcome to HealthApp, Do you have any history of taking any medicines that may cause the truncal rash . The rise in eosinophil points towards urticaria. Focal infection is a well documented cause of urticaria and it maybe due to infection in your parotids, you may be getting this. Once the infection is out of the system, maybe you will get better.Or else it can certainly be that you are allergic to some drug, or some food items, which trigger the urticaria, but that only you will have to find out and prevent the exposure.Take oral antiallergicslike cetrizine loratadine and see the response.

Yesterday I noticed my stomach region was starting to itch as well but no rash. Last night I woke up in the middle of the night and my stomach is covered in a red rash. It almost resembles a heat rash but it is not going away. I also noticed a few new spots on my knee and arm that are itching and look like the poison ivy. I have not been around any poison ivy and everything in my home has been treatedwashed since. I have also had diahrrea and stomach pain the past two days. I was not sure if this was all related or totally separate things. I was taking a 5 day dose of prednisone and my last dose was on Saturday.",
        "output": "From the information that you have given it seems that the two symptoms are different and due to different causes.Two weeks ago you probably had contact dermatitis to poison ivy,but the present symptoms suggest that you might be having some allergic reaction to some food products.Sometimes allergic reaction to food products can cause diarrhea, stomach pain along with hives over the body.You will need to take anti histamine tablets and apply calamine lotion over the hives.I would suggest you consume bland food for now,consume adequate amount of water to avoid dehydration and consult your allergist for further course of action.Hope it helps,"

        "output": "Hello,Welcome and thanks for posting your query to HealthApp.After reading your query it appears the possibility of Urticaria.Urticaria is a common condition caused by bursting of allergy producing cells known as mast cells. As the chemical inside them is released it produces a rash which you have mentioned. There can be multiple factors producing this condition which are included in day to day life and some times it is really difficult to find one exact cause. In your case you are correlating it with contact with cats. So it is better to stay away from the offending factors.For the betterment kindly follow the suggestions below-Apply over the counter calamine lotion 3-4 times a day.-You can do cold water compresses to reduce the intensity of itching.-Do not scratch or rub the skin as it can lead to further aggravation.-You can take oral anti histamine like loratadine or levocetrizine under medial advise.Despite above measures if the problem is not getting better then it is better to consult a dermatologist for best guidance.Hope these informations will help.With good health wishesDr Sanjay Kumar KanodiaMD Dermatology & STDs"

I suspect that you have Contact DermatitisContact dermatitis is a rash on the skin that can be itchy, painful, or tender. Sometimes it can cause blisters or swelling. Contact dermatitis is caused either by a substance that irritates the skin, or a substance that causes an allergy on the skin. Some substances that can cause contact dermatitis include soaps, perfumes, poison rubber products, cosmetics, jewelry, and medications.You usually can avoid further contact dermatitis by avoiding the substance that causes it, provided you are able to find the causeMost contact dermatitis is treated with corticosteroid skin creams or other skin creams or ointments. If the rash is severe, your doctor may suggest oral medications. Applying wet, cool compresses to the area or taking a cool bath can also help ease symptoms.Scratching the rash, rough clothing, and continued contact with the irritant or allergen can make the rash worse.Get the correct etiology including diet and treat accordingly.

I have recently 2 days ago came out in a very irritable rash across the side of my head. This started out like small but many bites but after a few hours of itching the lumps spread into each other and looked like bubbles with fluid inside that did pop if scratched. After a few hours I noticed a similar group of bites on my elbow upon an area of skin that had healed from a graze approximately 3 months ago. Again, after a scratching the small bumps linked to each other and bubbled. Several hours later I began to find other smaller areas of what first looked like bites, we re very itchy and when scratched, they leaked clear fluid and then bubbled and reddened. I have a third patch on my knee that is a more recent area of scar tissue that was perfectly healed but is affected with the rash. The rash has spread to my hands in small areas and my ankles in larger patches. I have since been reminded that the largest and first patch on my head is in exactly the same pattern as a recent 3 months ago head injury I sustained when I banged my head and caused some scabbing. I have checked a photo of the original injury to confirm this. It was quite a heavy blow to the head but apart from concussion I sustained no other problems. I have googled my symptoms but at this time of year and with work find little time to venture to my local and quite honestly, useless GP surgery. I thought it might be hives but the oddness of the scar tissue being affected has lead me here. Could it be stressed related.  I am stressed Look forward to a swift and conclusive reply.",

This only happens when I eat strawberries, berries, pineapples, zucchini, broccoli, bell peppers or any food similar to it. Also when I use any cosmetics were it contains glitter or when I use lipsticks closer to red tones I develop this hive, but when I use eyeliner, face powder containing no glitter, nothing happens. I only develop this hive the day after I eat or use these cosmetics. First symptoms, my face would turn red and it will feel itchy. Then a few hours later, my face will become swollen around the eye area. I used to be able to eat and use this product with no problem, I don t know what trigger my body to develop this allergy to certain products. Any idea what is going on.  Thank you",
        "output": "Hello, The symptoms you describe and the relation to foods does seem consistent with urticaria that can be triggered in some people by foods rich in salicylates. Urticaria is a condition when mast cells in the skin release histamine after simple triggers such as scratching physical, but also to temperature change such as hot shower or cold-induced urticaria, stress, infections etc. Foods high in salicylates can also trigger and the foods you mention do fall in that category. Long-acting antihistamines such as allegra 180mg once daily for 3 months should be tried to see the effect. Removing foods high in salicylates as a trial for a maximum period of 4 weeks is recommended, but not longer if there has no obvious effect. If there is evidence of tree or grass pollen allergy, then these can act as secondary triggers. You can visit the patient information website allergy.or.uk for more information on salicylates if you wish. Hope that helps. Best Wishes."

        "output": "Hi, The problem with dermatographism is that most of the times there is no specific cause for it. However at times hot baths, stress, anxiety, exercise and skin friction rubbing, scratching, minor pressure over skin can flare it up. The disorder usually goes into remission on its own , may be in few days or it might take few years to go. So the only thing that can be done is to take antiallergics to relieve the symptoms. As you said with allegra you are not having much of response, in that case you can consult the doctor to add one more group of antihistaminic. You can also apply soothing calamine lotion, it will reduce the itch to some extent. Take care."

Reviewing your history and pictures showed attachment removed to protect patient identity, there might be skin irritation which can be from repeated frictions like masturbation or reaction to the substance used it also can be due to vitamin deficiency or a skin condition like psoriasis, etc. Fungal infection is rare and it does not present as a spot usually it is whitish material and happens in people who are immune compromised like diabetics or people who have HIV infections. Since it is not itchy or painful you should not worry about it and you should not use Cortisone cream as it makes things worse. Keep good hygiene area should be dry and clean. Use nonchemical lubricant like olive oil if you masturbate. If you have changed your soap or shower gel it might be the cause. Take vitamin E and vitamin A to replace your vitamin deficiency. If you are known to have psoriasis then treatment can be by Methoteraxate cream but only for people who are known to have psoriasis.

Warts are now disappearing as I used Imiquimod for more than a month but it caused the skin around my anus red, little itchy, and inflamed. Please help. I am an HIV positive person. Can I use Candid around the anus.",
        "output": "Hello, Welcome to cliniq.com. I see you have taken all the necessary medications for the fissure in anus. What I would like to tell you is you need to do two more important things. Firstly, since you have fissure and piles I can guess you might have constipation quite commonly hence you must be straining to pass the stools so I suggest you stop straining while passing stools. Next, add fiber to your diet. Consuming one cucumber and carrot a day will help you a lot to avoid constipation. Also, drink plenty of water throughout the day. Secondly, how you use the medication is also important. I advise you to do a sitz bath twice a day add Betadine 5 ml in lukewarm water in a tub and sit on it for 5 to 10 minutes. Next apply the Lox-2 Lignocaine hydrochloride cream opaque and not gel, as gel does not get absorbed and the cream crosses the skin. Apply it before passing stools and immediately after cleaning yourself after passing the stools. You can apply it whenever you have severe pain also. You can also take syrup Lactulose 15 ml at night time after food for 10 days. For the piles, if you have third or fourth-degree piles then surgery is the only choice. For first and second degrees you can treat by tablet Daflon 500 mg one tablet a day for 14 days. Apply Pilex ointment or Hemoproct ointment before sleep in the anal region. Avoid anal sex if any until the fissure heals. Lastly, all acute fissure can be treated by the methods I have mentioned here and more than any medication follow the dietary advice and you can keep the fissure occurrence under control. However, if the fissure is persistent for more than two to three months it is better to get operated. Suggested operations are lateral internal sphincterotomy for the fissure and hemorrhoidectomy for piles. Also, keep a check on your viral load and Cd4 counts. I hope this helps."

I went to ER and they gave me Corticosteroids IV. Now, I was wondering if this means I am allergic to bee stings and if in future I get stung by a bee again does it mean anaphylacic attack can develop.",
        "output": "Hello. Yes, that is correct. It seems you are allergic to bee sting. For an allergic reaction to develop, initial exposure must occur in order for your body to create an immune response to it. This might have happened a few months ago when you were stung before. Since there was already an exposure and established immune response, subsequent exposure may result in allergic reaction. Severe allergic reaction resulting in anaphylaxis may occur but most of the time allergic reaction is mild and not life threatening. Symptoms such as excessive skin reactions, including hives and itching and flushed or pale skin, low blood pressure, constriction of your airways and a swollen tongue or throat, difficulty breathing, weak and rapid pulse, nausea, vomiting or diarrhea and dizziness or fainting warrants immediate consult.

Two weeks later, I developed symptoms of pain and slight swelling in my right testicle, lower abdominal pain, and foreskin inflammation. Thinking it to be chlamydia, I took 1g single dose of Azithromycin. It provided me some relief but two weeks later the same symptoms arose. Further, my foreskin and penile glans have now become sticky to touch, like a stick note, although it is not moist. I had also developed rashes on my inner thigh. I consulted a doctor who prescribed me T Bact for my sticky and slightly swollen foreskin, Betnovate N for my rashes in my inner thighs, and put me on a seven-day course of Amoxicillin 500 mg for three days.

The swelling of foreskin seems to have reduced somewhat. I am sending you the latest photos as well. Please advise me on what should be my next step.",
        "output": "Hi. I understand your worry about the swelling of the foreskin you covered with antibiotics with a single dose of Azithromycin and later with one week of Amoxicillin. If there is sexually transmitted disease it might come back for mainly two reasons. Firstly, incomplete treatment and insensitive antibiotics as you did not have a culture result, and secondly, not treating the sexual partner. Therefore, after completing the Amoxicillin no need for more antibiotics hopefully the foreskin swelling resolves. You will need STD sexually transmitted disease screening for you and your partner needs a vaginal swab. If you got pain like burning sensation while passing urine or swelling or urethral discharge then you will need to do urethral swab culture as well. The swelling of the foreskin and sticky discharge might have been caused by sexually transmitted disease as the condom was torn we do not have culture results as you started antibiotics before a culture of your urethra was sent. It is great that with Amoxicillin you are getting better. My suggestion is to complete the Amoxicillin course. Then to do the sexually transmitted diseases tests STD screening which is chlamydia testing by swab taken from urethra, gonorrhea testing, syphilis tests, trichomonas tests, human papillomavirus HPV, herpes test, hepatitis B surface antigen test, hepatitis C test, HIV antibody and HIV antigen blood test for you and your partner. Those investigations will help diagnose and prevent future recurrence. No need for any more medications for now apart from the Amoxicillin you are currently on I would be pleased to follow you after tests result to inform for further treatment if required. Urethral swab for partner and STD screen for both and urethral swab of the patient in case symptomatic. STD sexually transmitted disease."

If this was a high quantitative PCR test and if it was negative, then you are completely safe. If it was antibody test, and was negative, then I suggest to confrim with quantitative HCV PCR test. The antibody response to HCV viral infection is slow, hence a negative antibody tests does not confirm absence of infection. Means it can be falsely negative. Quantitative HCV PCR if negative then it can confirmly rule out the infection. For example if you were exposed, then PCR test can come positive as earliest as 1 to 2 weeks.

HSV-1 IgG 4.5 positive. HSV-1 IgM 0.29 negative. HSV-2 IgG 0.45 negative. HSV-2 IgM 0.69 negative. As HSV-1 is mostly non-genital infection. I did not have any episodes of HSV-1 type herps in my life. I never had HSV-1 type herpes anywhere in the body. I am straight and have a relationship only with my spouse. How can blood show HSV-1 IgG positive without any symptoms.  Dermatologist says it is due to past infection and not about present infection. Doctor told I should take antiviral dose Acyclovir for 20 days for HSV-1 IgG past infection. Is it useful to take antiviral dose for the past HSV-1 type infection.  Will it reduces IgG level in the blood.  Is HSV-1 IgG is false positive.",
        "output": "Hi. First understand the situation, IgM indicates recent infection and IgG indicate chronic infection. Since you have both the IgM negative, it means that there is no recent infection. Secondly, about 70- 80 of US population is HSV-1 herpes simplex virus positive, it means they are infected once in a life time and antibodies will remain for throughout life. But it does not mean that 80 of US population should start taking Acyclovir. There are no guidelines for taking Acyclovir until you are symptomatic. So do not think too much about this figure. If you had any other problems, you can revert back to me."

        "instruction": "Hello doctor, I am 29-year-old, married male. I have a baby who feeds on breast milk. I had a sexual encounter before 8 months with a professional with a condom. I am 95 sure that my protection was intact. Then I started reading about the HIV symptoms and technicalities of testing online. Five days later, I went to a Dermatology and Venereology specialist and described about the incident. He was confident enough that he advised me not to go for any testing. Although my fear of infection remained. Around two months post-exposure, I felt tenderness here and there like on the back of my head, arms, one lymph node in my underarm was swollen and I developed cold and cough. I started sweating during that time as well. I looked a bit thinner. I got panicked and went to the doctor again. He checked me and was still confident that I am not infected. But for my mental satisfaction, he prescribed me thorough testing which includes HIV12, VDRL, HBsAg, HCV along with urine RE, ME, CS analysis. On 74 th day post-exposure I took all those tests and they all came back negative. After lapse of a few days again I felt some skin irritation on theback and burning sensation on my forearms. Although no skin changes can be seen. Again I got panicked thinking that I may be in the window period for HIV. But the doctor remained confident and he adivised me not to go for any repeat testing. But my sense of fear, anxiety, panic, guilt, and impurity continues. On 110th day post-exposure again I repeated the tests but I excluded the urine analysis this time. All the tests came negative again. The HIV tests were fourth-generation combo test both the time. I am on the eighth month post exposure. Still, I feel tenderness hear and there. Recently, I am developing small red blood vessel like dots just underneath my skin on my hand and feet which is staying for 5-7days and going away leaving faint black spots. I again showed it to the same doctor. He is confident and repeatedly asked me to stop worrying. He also gave me anti-anxiety, anti-OCD, anti-depressant drugs. I am also taking sessions with a psychologist. But still, my mind is not free from the fear of HIV and also fear that my wife and child might get infected by me. My questions are, do I need to repeat any test to out rule the probability of HIV.  Are there any probability of error from lab test given the fact that I took the tests twice.  Do I need to worry about the window period as there is conflicting information available on the internet.  Do I need to worry about the phenomenon of delayed seroconversion.  Do I need to opt for the tests from a different lab.  Do I need to worry about HIV 12anymore.  How to unroot the fear from deep inside my mind.  Any other opinion on my history.",
        "output": "Hi. The chances of transmission of HIV by the given description is almost nil. HIV tests are repeatedly negative and after three months of exposure it is conclusive. You are free from HIV. There is no need for you to worry about seroconversion. You can forget about the episode and lead a normal life. There is no need for any further HIV tests in any lab. Just relax. Do some yoga, exercises, meditation, etc."

I was checked for STDs about three or four weeks ago and everything came back negative. I had protected sex with a condom last week, but had unprotected oral sex. How likely is it that this is STD.  I am also on Viorele, an oral contraceptive and I know sometimes that this can cause discharge. What could this be.",
        "output": "Hello. Yes, oral sex could transmit STD sexually transmitted disease and they are herpes simplex, gonorrhea or even syphilis. Infections less frequently passed on include chlamydia, HIV and hepatitis A. But, I must tell you that the risks of getting an STD from unprotected oral sex are typically much lower than the risks posed by having unprotected vaginal or anal sex. This is because saliva often contains the antibacterial and antiviral agents. I think of a rescreen if it persists for more than a week or changes its behavior as you never know how you could contract STD.

She is taking calcium and vitamin D for her osteoporosis and I have given her some vitamin K2 and D3 drops as well from time to time. She is 85 years old.",
        "output": "Hello, Welcome to icliniq.com. I can understand your concern. According to your statement your grandmother have been suffering from purple spots on leg and arm with osteoporosis. When small blood vessels are ruptured causing blood to pool under the skin and can create purple spots on the skin are known as purpura. Purpura may be resulted from illnesses such as bleeding disorder, recent history of blood transfusion, cancer, SLE systemic lupus erythematosus, infections like HIV human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis C, CMV cytomegalovirus, EBV Epstein Barr virus, etc. It may also occur due to inflammation of blood vessels, blood stream infection, vitamin C deficiencies, medications like Heparin, Aspirin, Sulphonamide, steroid, chemotherapy, Digoxin, Hormone replacement therapy, etc. Purpura are usually benign and may resulted from above mentioned causes and it sizes can vary from small dots to large patches. Senile purpura is benign which affects older people as their skin and underlying blood vessels become more fragile with aging and may bleed from minor trauma. The treatment depends on causes and most of the purpura does not need any treatment and dissolved over time. It may take 4 to 6 weeks to heal. The treatment are only needed for those which are not disappeared over time. You can use topical retinoids along with her current medications. I want to add that according to the pictures attachment removed to protect patient identity that are shown here, your grandmother have been suffering from age-related senile purpura. Give her vitamin C and citrus foods like orange, lemon, etc., with application of sunscreen and sun-protective clothing along with previously mentioned medications."

        "output": "Hello, Sir, I am a family doctor from Icliniq and will try to answer your questions. It seems to me that you have two. The first concerns your use of Tylenol and Advil. You may not have meant to say overdose. If however, you have taken more than 800 mg of Ibuprofen or 1000 mg of Tylenol, those are excessive doses and could be associated with side effects. I would advise you to call the Canadian or US Poison Control Center. They give excellent free advice about overdoses. The second question is in regard to your fever and weight loss. I am not sure how long those things have been going on. With COVID-19 in your area, it is possible this could be your problem. There are many other causes of fever, such as influenza and various other viral and bacterial infections. Often when a fever falls, a person can feel chilled. Some things that you can do besides using Ibuprofen 400 mg up to three times a day or Tylenol 1000 mg three times a day include drinking alit of liquids getting rest and isolating your self from others. Things that would make you want to seek a doctor is care would be increasing cough, trouble breathing, chest pain, trouble thinking clearly or inability to care for yourself. I will pray that you feel better soon. Please let us know if you are not getting better or have additional questions."

I have ulcers, sore throat, occasional oral thrush, difficulty swallowing, lump on the throat larynx, night sweats, fever, loose teeth, and abnormal discoloration in mouth. I am currently on birth control patch, Dextro-amphetamine and Cymbalta. I have been struggling for months now with quite a few mouth and throat issues. I have constant mouth ulcers that are taking weeks to heal, I get the sensation that I have not swallowed something completely down and that it stuck so I will keep swallowing and swallowing it drives me mad. It is not easy for me to keep doing this because swallowing feels harder than it should be almost like my throat is too swollen. I have a sore throat 80 of the time. I have odd waves of oral thrush and my mouth also has pale and red areas on my soft palate, my hard palate is just very pale. I have a couple of loose teeth but otherwise in very good shape. Frequent random nose bleeds that are usually heavy but can be light at times. Night sweats every night and feeling easily overheated during the days. I have also now become more concerned since my throat developed a hard lump on the top of my larynx. It feels very swollen where it is almost like it is ready to explode. It does not move and it stays firm putting a lot of pressure on my throat. I am assuming this is why it feels hard to swallow. It does not hurt but if I push on it to feel the firmness it causes discomfort to the surroundings mostly underneath the lump.",
        "output": "Hi. First and foremost, I would advise you not to panic or get disheartened. According to me, there is no major issue out there and we usually encounter such issues very often in our outpatient department. Now looking at your case, oral ulcers can be due to various causes right from nutritional and vitamin deficiencies to infections or repeated trauma. Getting each and every parameter tested often becomes extremely expensive and might frustrate you even more. Coming to your second major concern, difficulty in swallowing with no major pain as such can be due to some ulcers down in your throat, or infection in your pharynx throat, or constant gastric irritation. Advice 1. Consider taking a good multivitamin for two to three months. 2. Follow a healthy, hygienic lifestyle. 3. Avoid smoking, alcohol, etc. 4. Avoid having spicy, oily, and junk food items. 5. Salt water gargles at least 8 to 10 times a day. You should keep your oral cavity free from contaminating organisms and hence the throat infection. 6. Keep sipping on boiled warm water. 7. Consider antireflux therapy if you have the slightest of reflux issues. 8. Get your viral markers for HIV, HbsAg and blood sugars done too. 9. Do not Google too much of your symptoms out. 10. Do not correlate too many unnecessary things and do not take stress at any cost, sometimes stress can be responsible for non-healing ulcers."

My simptoms were red spots regularly appearing and disappearing. They were not itchy except slightly on the scalp and forefront. Shower was exacerbating the symptoms for about 30 min, but a reaction to shampoo and soap were excluded as this was happening even only with water. I took oral antifungal on GP prescription, but nothing changed. Now for the wierd part. I work as a PhD student in preclinical oncology. I often work with mice and I realized that some of the mice I came in contact with were developing red spots. The only difference is that while my spots are slightly swallowed, on the mice they are deep like the outer layer of the skin is missing. The vet said they are not in pain. They seem not to spread the disease e.g. 6 mice per cage, only 1 with symptoms for several months. This happens only on mice I came in contact with. The spots on mice extend with time up to 20 of the skin surface for what we observed, but causing no mortality. The mice used here are NMRI nude mice lacking T-linfocytes. I think an atypical dermatitis is not contagious, so how could it be.  Could my diagnosis be wrong or are the spots on the mice an uncorrelated thing.  Than you in advance for any help",

        "output": "Hello. According to your statement, you have been suffering from a few painful, hard bumps at the back right of the tongue, and in front of the right tonsil and feel uncomfortable during swallowing. Usually inflamed papillae or taste buds are small, painful bumps that appear after an injury from a bite or irritation from the hot foods. Herpes is a common viral infection that can develop blisters on the tongue or gums. Oral herpes is contagious and can spread through saliva, direct contact, sexual exposure, etc. Canker sores may appear on the tongue which are red, white or yellow in appearance and can feel raw and very painful. Some foods seem to trigger cankers sore. Again food intolerances and allergic reactions may cause bumps on the tongue and it may swollen. An infection in the mouth or on the tongue may cause swelling and pain at the site of the infection. People with syphilis sometimes develop tongue sore as an early symptom of the disease and can contract the infection through direct contact during vaginal, oral, or anal sex. People with oral thrush usually notice rough white patches on the tongue and there is often redness and a sour mouth as well. It can result from DM diabetes mellitus, HIV, nutritional deficiencies, some medications like corticosteroid, etc. Even TB tuberculosis, carcinoma can develop bumps on the tongue. Treatment depends on the causes of the bumps. You can use antifungal medication, antibiotics, antiviral medication, and maintain good oral hygiene. You should provide some additional history like smoking, substance abuse, previous disease, medications, history of sexual activities, fever. etc."

But please do not be disheartened if sometimes no cause is found which happens quite a lot of times. Dear, Progesterone injection will never cause miscarriages as progesterone is the hormone that is required for the continuation of pregnancy and act as a support for pregnancy. So the most common causes for recurrent miscarriages can be either Thyroid hormonal abnormalities or impaired blood glucose levels, or sometimes immune causes like APLA syndrome. As per your LMP, you are exactly 6wks pregnant today, so try to get a scan to check if this is a viable pregnancy and also for dating and localisation of pregnancy, so that if viable we can start with progesterone support in the form of oral progesterone supplements to sustain this pregancy. Also I have mentioned the blood test that you need to undertake apart from the routine Antenatal investigations to look for any abnormalities I mentioned above. Please do get them done. Please feel free to contact me in case you have any queries. - Blood group and Rh Typing, - Complete hemogram, - Hb Electrophoresis, - Urine routine and microscopy, - LFT RFT - 75 g Oral Glucose tolerance test  in each Trimester. - HbA1c level, - HIV, VDRL, HBSAg, Anti HCV. - APLA work up that includes 1 Lupus Anticoagulant, 2 Beta 2 Glycoprotein IgG & IgM, 3 Anti cardiolipin antibodies IgG & IgM. - NT scan 11-13weeks, - Dual marker test  11-13weeks. - Level 2 Scan 18-20weeks - to look for any structural or developmental anomalies in the fetus. - To consider progesterone supplements either oral, vaginal or injectables after checking viability. - Low dose aspirin or Heparin may be considered after Ultrasound for viability & the blood tests evaluation. - Avoid intercourse in the first trimester. - Small meals at frequent intervals to avoid nausea or bloating."

I have read on the internet that window period for HIV is three months and hence to confirm I have undergone HIV testing called ELISA. The result of which is non-reactive and the value is 0.062. Again, now I repeated the test and it showed result as non-reactive with the value of 0.104. The two reports have been attached here. Regarding symptoms, I did not develop any fever or allergy in the last four months. Is ELISA test reliable.  Is there any need for me to take any other test or repeat the test.  Can I stop worrying as I have already covered window period.  Why did the test show some value like 0.6 and 0.104.  Does it indicate the presence of any disease.  What is the window period.

But, things I memorized before some years are still remain in my head. For example, as a hobby, I learnt mathematical pi, I can still recite it. But, I have forgotten some numbers and I am frequently mixing things up. Another thing that has happened is that I cannot sleep at nights. I have to leave the window open and wrapped in several blankets to sleep, because either I feel too hot or too cold where in a split second I am either sweating or shivering. I also get massive waves of heat or cold. My hands and feet normally go cold and numb during my cold episodes and when I get hot, I feel dizzy and nauseous. I feel distressed.

Then after five years I did HIV test ELISA 1 and 2 and it came back negative. I was about to get married that time. I did not believe the results because my brain keeps telling me maybe the last laboratory did not do a good job or maybe the one who is working in the laboratory did not know how to perform the test.

You will need to visit a psychiatrist and he will prescribe you SSRI type of medicines such as Escitalopram 10 mg, or Fluoxetine 20 mg, etc which will help with your problem. It basically happens when some neurotransmitters such as serotonin reduce in your brain leading to a problem with handling the day to day stresses of life. Medicines are usually given for two to four months and then tapered off slowly and stopped. In addition to the medicines, you can also undergo a few sessions of cognitive-behavioral therapy from a clinical psychologist. Also, do consider doing deep breathing exercises or progressive muscle relaxation daily. T. Nexito 10 mg Escitalopram 10 mg daily one at night after food."

I asked him about needle changing to which he said he did. My concern is what are the chances of contracting HIV in worst-case scenario that he did not change a few needles. Also till now I never had any fever or body pain or infection around the tattoo made.",
        "output": "Hello. Needle can transmit HIV only if the needle was freshly used in another person send the amount of blood collected in the needle is significant. This is because the HIV virus dies very quickly outside the body. In my opinion, the odds of transferring HIV infection in the above scenario are quite less as the chances of both these conditions are present together is very less. It is a good point that you have not had any fever or other symptoms. Testing is being mentioned because we are talking about the worst-case scenario. In short, testing not needed ordinarily after tattooing, however, if you have much doubt about due precautions taken by the artist, you can go for it."

        "output": "Hi. Antibodies are the proteins produced by the body in response to fight the foreign substance antigen, virus, infectious agent it enters the body. When antigen enters the body, it stimulates the immune system to produce antibodies. It is very difficult to tell that how much time a particular person takes to develop antibodies. Your negative HIV antibody test at 120 days means that 99.9 of your body has not been exposed to HIV. The test kits used these days are highly sensitive and specific and give accurate results.120 days HIV negative test is highly conclusive of your negative HIV status. But, I think that you are not letting it go. The symptoms are more likely due to stress. There are very rare cases reported in the literature where the person has been exposed to antigen but the time taken by the body to produce detectable antibodies was longer, up to six months.

The most recent consultation said these tests were the best out there and I can rely on the results I have. Your professional opinion is much appreciated.",
        "output": "Hi. The test which you underwent on day 8 and 16 was definitely the best available test for that duration and you can surely rely upon the results. This test is highly sensitive for this duration to catch the infection if there had been any exposure. As far as the timing of this test is concerned it is conclusive as early as 7-14 days post-infection. Unlike the other tests, this will always give a positive result as long as there is HIV in someone is blood. Also, if there had been an HIV infection, HIV antibodies must be present in the person is blood. Studies have shown that the majority of the HIV antibodies develop in two to eight weeks period if there had been any exposure to HIV. Furthermore, I suggest you to undergo an HIV antibody test also and at this time you can undertake fourth generation HIV rapid test. This is again a highly sensitive and specific test and gives accurate result. If the same is negative, then you repeat the rapid HIV antibody test at three months. I hope this helps."

        "output": "Hello, Welcome back to icliniq.com. To answer your query, I want to give reference of published research that, Although the reported sensitivity and specificity of fourth generation tests are more than 99 in numerous studies, there are several instances of discordance between screening and confirmatory techniques Liu P et al. AIDS Research and Therapy 2016 131. False positivity can be due to user error or cross contamination, if there is ongoing some other illness eg. malaria, or if there is a history of blood transfusion, autoimmune diseases. A positive test result always needs to be routinely confirmed using a different type of test or testing kit. Fourth generation tests are more than 95 accurate at six weeks and this needs to be confirmed after three months with a second test. If the test in your case has been performed at three months after the exposure and is giving negative results, and you have not had another risk, you do not have HIV. Your fourth generation test and RNA PCR at 9 and 10 weeks and further 12 weeks negative RNA PCR, suffices to rule out infection. If you still have apprehension, get a repeat HIV antibody test at six months of exposure, no need to repeat it in between. Take precautions in the future consistent and correct condom usage.

I am pretty nervous regarding the same. Can you please advise me what are the chances of contracting HIV and do the symptoms definitely occur in every individual post-HIV contraction.",
        "output": "Hello. Firstly, risk depends upon whether that guy has HIV or not. If not then nothing to worry, but considering the second possibility, then some risk remains of transmission, but not cent percent. Now, if the test is negative after five to six weeks then it is unlikely for you to have HIV as majority of those who are exposed becomes positive within this period. Only a minority of patients develop delayed seroconversion. So considering overall status, I think, there is no need to worry about it and you are unlikely to have HIV. However, get tested after a few weeks to clear out doubt and be sure. So you should not worry now and get back to routine, and get tested at later date. I hope this helps."

        "instruction": "Hello doctor, My father had cataract surgery yesterday. His sugar levels were fine before surgery. Today he was given a Dexa injection 2 ml in his eye due to inflammation. After that the sugar levels have stayed between 280 -300 through out. Just before dinner, his sugar levels were 300 mgdL. As advised by our doctor have gave him 16 units of Mixtard instead of 14 which he takes regularly along with regular sugar medicines. My questions are Does Dexa injection increase the sugar so much and when will the effect go.  In addition, he is also putting one drop of steroid eye drops Predmet every hour. From tomorrow, it will be once every three hours. Can this also increase the sugar level.  From tomorrow how should we manage the sugar levels.  Will the effect of steroids go away.  Please see the attached prescription of all the eye drops after cataract surgery. He is taking Mixtard Insulin 3070 - 50 units in the morning,14 units in the night, Glycomet GP2 1-0-1, Linagliptin 5 mg 1-0-0, Fibator 10 mg -0-0-1, Metolar 25 -1-0-0, Dynapres 0.4 - 0-0-1, Arreno 1-0-1, Ecosprin 75 1-0-0, Thyronorm 25 mg one tablet from Monday to Thursday and two tablets from Friday to Sunday, Cap Uprise once a month.",
        "output": "Hello, Welcome to icliniq.com. I just read your query and from what you have mentioned it appears that your father is blood sugar has increased because of steroids. As for your questions let me answer them one by one. Yes, Dexa injection increases the sugar so much and it will have decreased effect once your father is off steroids completely. Yes, steroid eye drops Predmet Methylprednisolone can also increase sugar level. Regarding managing the sugar levels, if his fasting is above 250 then increase his evening dose of Insulin by adding two more units. If his dinner blood sugar is 250 mgdL above then add two more units to his morning dose of Insulin and continue monitoring accordingly. If drops to 200 then do not increase his insulin at all and maintain at that dose of insulin. Keep following his blood sugar closely and watch for any signs of hypoglycemia as well like increase sweating or shivering or headache or hunger or cold skin, etc. I hope this helps."

        "instruction": "Hello doctor, I am a 42-year-old male. My height is 5 11 and I weigh about 120 kg. I do not do any exercise. Just a month ago, I experienced painful stomach cramps, diarrhea, excessive gas, sweating, and belching with bad taste which lasted for one night. I rested up for two days and felt much better but a cold sore appeared on my lip which again only last a few days. I am not sure if it is related but quite shortly the aforementioned incident I noticed enlarged papillae slightly apart from the others. I was naturally curious so rubbed it with my finger and it did not feel any pain so I just forgot about that. Shortly after I started to feel pain in my tongue, the pain would change location throughout the day and often move to my hard palate. I then noticed my tongue appeared white coated. I started to use oral thrush lozenges, rinse my mouth with mouthwash, gargle with warm water and salt, brush my teeth and tongue before bed I never used to. After a few weeks, my tongue appeared pinker but the pain is still on and off. I finished the lozenges hoping that would be the end of it but I have noticed today that my tongue again appears white-coated and I now feel sore on the hard plate near the front teeth, also a new cold sore has appeared. I have read and looked at the photos about oral thrush, hairy tongue and so on but really I have no idea what my condition is. I have not been to see a doctor or dentist because quite honestly I am very scared. Reading that white-coated tongue causes can be anything from excessive alcohol, tobacco use right through to HIV or cancer is simply terrifying me. I did purchase a diabetes home test kit urine which did not show any traces. I drink and vape once a week but on that day I consume both excessively. Please shed some light and guidance. Photos run in chronological order.",
        "output": "Hi. First of all, thank you for the detailed history of your symptoms and photos which you have attached. attachment removed to protect patient identity. Before I discuss further about possible diagnosis let me assure you that your symptoms or the photos you have sent do not show anything sinister in your mouth or tongue. Analysis of your symptoms are suggestive of a condition known as laryngopharyngeal reflux disorder LPRD where backflow of digestive acid causes significant injury to throat and mouth structures including tongue and palate. In your case symptoms seems to be triggered by an initial attack of acute gastritis and reflux, which may have caused significant injury. Acid can injure tongue papillae causing a coating of tongue, multiple small ulcerations, inflammation of tongue papillae. If the reflux continues to occur it can keep injuring different areas of tongue and mouth leading to migration of symptoms. Occasional binge drinking and vaping seems to be causing further damage to already injured tissue. You may need to take a few week course of anti-reflux medications and avoid drinking and vaping while on treatment to facilitate the healing process. Other than this I do not see anything dangerous as per the photos you have attached. Also, it does not look like oral thrush oral candidiasis. So antifungal lozenges may not be of much use."

        "instruction": "Hello doctor, I am writing to you in connection with my partner is allergic reaction which happens when we are together. Basically she is already allergic to dust and has atopy on her right hand since she was a child now she is 23 and I am 27, which is sometimes stronger, sometimes weaker but always there. As she is a Japanese girl living in Japan, we have met three times in various places, but her symptoms have appeared every time. Small red rashes appear on the hands and later on the legs too. Her face gets itchy and breaks out in pimples too. These always start days after meeting again and get better some days after we leave each other. We also tried sleeping apart and that helped a bit on the symptoms no sexual intercourse yet. So I am afraid I might have something that makes her produce such reactions. She also blames my dreadlocks which indeed catch not few dust but I will cut it before we meet soon so that possibility will be crossed out. Because of her dust allergy, they live in a very clean environment so I also suspect that staying longer at an inherently dustier place like my flat might get her reactions acting up. Also, she had a lot of stress because of traveling to meet me, which also does not help such skin diseases. In some places, we slept in hotels, so we always suspected the local washing powders to cause these effects but in my work place I deliberately bought a new linen bed to avoid such a problem although I washed it before using it. Dishes were different in the three countries so I cannot see that there would be a common ground for an allergic reaction. I will buy new clothes and will wash them myself according to her hygienic discipline and we will see how it goes. I do not regularly use deodorant, nor aftershave and I had different shower gels all the time. What else could we change to stop her reactions or to find out what caused them.  How could we soothe them.  Maybe after being together for a long time she would get used to my flora and she would eventually stop her reactions in an environment with less stress.  Of course, I sent her to a specialist as well to get checked to see whether I can be the cause.",
        "output": "Hello. You have described your partner is problem very nicely. She is suffering from chronic urticaria. Urticaria is an allergic reaction that takes the form of itchy red bumps on the skin as shown in your pictures. attachment removed to protect patient identity. Name anything that can cause an allergy, and it can also cause hives including pollen, dust, dander, dust mites, shellfish, and other foods. First thing, in the management is to find out the trigger. To avoid hives, you need to figure out what causes them. If you do not know, start keeping a daily diary. The most probable suspects are things that you eat, drink, or swallow, drink, supplements, and medications. But even if you do not see any obvious connections, continue keeping your diary, noting other factors like weather, stress levels, clothing, or the amount of time that you spend in the sun. With careful tracking, you may link a specific lifestyle factor with the eruption of those red, itchy welts. Foods most likely to trigger hives include shellfish, nuts, chocolate, fish, tomatoes, eggs, fresh berries, and milk. Some people react to preservatives in certain foods and wine, such as sulfites. Once you have identified a food trigger, eliminate it from your diet and see whether you have fewer outbreaks. Common drug triggers include antibiotics and non\u00adsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs NSAIDs such as Aspirin and Ibuprofen. But doctors have heard about many other triggers, including sedatives, tranquilizers, diuretics, diet supplements, antacids, arthritis medications, vitamins, eye drops, eardrops, laxatives, and douches. Seek emergency medical treatment if you develop hives around your eyes or in your mouth or experience difficulty breathing, wheezing, light-headedness, or dizziness. You may have a life-threatening condition called anaphylaxis, and the internal tissue swelling can block breathing passages. So better you get done her blood allergy test. That will give you a clue about your trigger so that you can avoid it. Tablet Levocetirizine or Desloratidine are helpful when you have a rash. Calamine lotion or astringents help shrink blood vessels, so they do not leak so much of histamine or mix one teaspoon of any kind of vinegar with one tablespoon of lukewarm water and apply the mixture to your hives with a cotton ball or tissue to soothe the itching. Take Fish oil in capsule form three times a day. The primary treatment is to increase the immunity of the body. An excellent remedy is to take one teaspoon of turmeric powder Haridra khand with a glass of milk or water two to three times a day. Massage the skin with mustard oil for 15 minutes, followed by a bath with lukewarm water. Make a paste of two cups of oatmeal and three teaspoons of cornstarch and water. Apply this paste on the affected areas until the itching is reduced. Stress can cause hives or make them worse. So avoid it in any form. Try meditation or yoga to boost your immunity. So after allergy test avoid that specific trigger. I hope this helps."

The ELISA enzyme-linked immuno0sorbent assay detects antibodies to HIV antigens whereas the combi test detects both antibodies and antigen. Since you have done these tests much after the exposure, I believe there is a little chance that you could be harboring HIV infection. The rashes you have developed are more likely to be a part of Crohn is disease syndrome progression. Humira, although may suppress the production of antibodies, it does not affect the detection of HIV antigen. Crohn is disease has various non-intestinal manifestations that could crop up anytime. I believe the new rashes are a part of Crohn is disease syndrome complex."

        "output": "Hello. Thanks for sharing your medical info with us. In terms of HIV detection tests, ELISA enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay test is the first test to be done and then if positive, western blot is recommended. You and your partner have both tested negative with rapid HIV test which guarantees the exclusion of HIV. You mentioned burning sensation on soles and palms. I am wondering if you also have lesions in these areas. The bumps you are experiencing are however, due to some other etiologies most likely molluscum contagiosum. These lesions have an umbilicated appearance they might itch and sore. They are extremely contagious but fortunately, they resolve on their own without any treatment. You might or might not have these lesions at the moment. Keep in mind these lesions could also be stress rashes, common after sexual activities. If the lesions still exist and hurt and do not have the typical umbilicated appearance. I recommend taking a biopsy so investigate the pathology. If they do not exist at the moment, plan on taking a biopsy when they reappear. The burning sensation you feel in your palms and soles is due to a different pathology, most likely a neuropathy. Further information needed to put the right diagnosis on these symptoms, most importantly a detailed history of when and how they started.  And how long have you been experiencing this burning sensation.  Do you have any medical history or family history of diabetes.  Nonetheless, these symptoms are not related to HIV infection. All I can recommend for assuring a reliable HIV test result is to repeat the test three months after exposure and see if you are still test negative. Rarely antibody formation might take longer than usual."

I just googled what could be cause for the same. It says it could be because of viral infections including HIVAIDS. I am worried now. I am scared to consult a doctor at the moment. Please advise.",
        "output": "Hello. Monocytes may increase or decrease, it hardly matters. One of the cause is viral disease. Not only HIV virus may cause this, but there are also many other viruses like cytomegala virus which can cause this. Flu is also caused by virus. Nowadays, fever is also called as viral fever, which takes a prolonged time to recover. If you are suffering from a common cold, or sneezing it is also viral. Nowadays in any disease one of the causes is viral. Monocytes are not so important except for in leukemia blood cancer which can be detected by peripheral blood film in which monocytes are highly increased. But in your case, the values are a little bit deranged. Have you noticed any symptoms.  In the case of HIV infection, various types of symptoms appears even joint pain, sore throat, ulcers in oral cavity, rashes, and itching are common. Advise- Take a healthy homemade diet both vegetarian and nonvegetarian. Maintain proper oral hygiene of oral cavity and genitalia. Undergarments should be washed properly and soaked with Dettol or Savlon. Add citrus fruits like lemon, orange, kiwi, and blueberry in your diet. It increases immunity and overall physical fitness. Treatment Take anti-oxidant like Revital for male one at night with milk, and Seven seas cod liver oil pearls one at night. Both can be continued for a long time. They help in general body maintenance and blood picture. I hope this helps."

I went to an allergic specialist for skin testing because my skin was so sensitive I reacted to everything. They then did the RAST test on me. Everything came out class 0 except for egg white, wheat, and oats being class 2 and milk, and hazelnut being class 1. Can these cause anaphylaxis.  How accurate are the RAST test.  I was put on an elimination diet but the hives are still there. I occasionally get angioedema with it also. Can angiodema cause anaphylaxis.  As you can see I am so scared for my throat to close up that I am scared to eat anything. I have only been eating a couple of things daily and live off that.",
        "output": "Hello, Welcome to icliniq.com. RAST is a highly accurate test. If the test is positive for a specific allergen, it shows that you are sensitized to that particular allergen. This means that you may mount an allergic response when you are exposed to that allergen. However, it does not mean that you will necessarily have an allergic reaction to that substance and, nor does it mean that any reactions will be severe. If the test is negative, it means that one does not have the ability to mount an allergic reaction to that allergen and any symptoms one may be experiencing are probably not due to an allergic reaction to that substance. However, the results of the RAST need to be interpreted in conjunction with your clinical history. e.g the presence of allergy to some or few allergens which may possibly be present either in the environment or food does not necessarily mean that they are responsible for the symptoms because if they are not even present in the environment or food of an individual, then they are irrelevant. In your case, an elimination diet has not helped thus proving the fact that RAST test results should be carefully interpreted along with clinical history and does not necessarily mean that you will necessarily have an allergic reaction to the substance that you tested. Angioedema is frequently associated with urticaria. Pathogenesis is the same for both urticaria as well as angioedema. The presence of angioedema does not always mean that it is a part of anaphylaxis. Angioedema can be a part of anaphylaxis in those individuals who have a severe allergic reaction to an allergen with high levels of antibodies circulating in the blood. Since you have only class 1 and 2 level antibodies therefore it is unlike that these antigens or allergens would cause anaphylaxis."

        "output": "Hello. Generally, the HIV infection takes few days to years to produce the symptoms it is called as incubation period. The incubation period is not fixed in HIV infection. It is the time taken for the organism to establish itself within the human body. As all of us know that HIV establishes when one is immunity comes down. So, if someone is immunity is good enough, he may not develop any symptoms even after HIV infection. If the immunity had come down, then the HIV infections will be expressed. Thus, the clinical symptoms appear based on patients immunity. Similarly, the few tests show positive only after the immunity has come down. But, there are some confirmation tests that tell about HIV even in the early stages. The fourth generation HIV test is one among such tests. Thus, we can come to the conclusion that you are HIV negative. The peripheral neuropathy may be due to other causes. Definitely, it is not due to HIV. The first symptoms of HIV infections are continuous fever, body weight loss and chronic diarrhea. In advanced cases, there will be white coating in tongue, continuous sputum expulsion by cough and peripheral neuropathy. I feel you no need to repeat the HIV test again. If you still want, do it after one year. Be prepare your mind that HIV is negative for you. It is the confirmation test."

She belongs to a poor family though she has been visiting many ayurvedic, homeopathic MD is no one is able to figure out the exact reason. There might be chances of bone cancer.  She had already spent lots of money and now she is losing hope. Please help.",
        "output": "Hi. It seems from what you have mentioned that your friend is a 30-year-old lady with frequent episodes of fever and bone pain assuming that the bone problems you mentioned are bone pains at multiple locations. If she is indeed only 70 lbs, then it is likely that she is cachexic. This along with the frequent fevers gives us a major red flag for two serious conditions that she might have tuberculosis TB, or tumor anywhere in the body. Let us discuss these two possibilities. Tuberculosis is endemic and is more common than we think. Most individuals already have the bacteria in them, and the disease occurs when their immunity reduces. Long-standing low grade fevers, loss of appetite and weight, history of contact with someone who had active TB, and low socioeconomic living conditions are quite likely to cause TB. While TB most commonly involves the lungs causing a chronic cough. TB can affect almost any system in the body. One may have musculoskeletal TB involving the spine, joints and any of the bones. If your friend is bone pains are related to TB, she should have pain at only a few locations in her body, unless she is immunocompromised. Tumors or cancer anywhere in the body can cause loss of appetite and weight. Low-grade fevers may occur in some tumors, while the spread of tumor tissue to bones will lead to bone pains and pathological fractures. Tumors arising from the bones are a definite possibility. Finally, besides TB and tumors, there are other rarer causes cachexia and bone pains. These include nutritional deficiency disorders like osteomalacia, HIV infection, certain medications that reduce immunity, etc. It might be a good idea for her to take pictures of all the tests that she has undergone, and also any x-rays or imaging that she may have got done till now. You may upload these on this platform and we could discuss her issues further. I understand she may be losing hope from any medical intervention, and such disease-related depression is quite common. If she has consulted only ayurvedic doctors till now, it may be prudent to take opinions from allopathic doctors. It is quite possible that her diagnosis may have been missed. Lastly, I would sincerely suggest that you take at least verbal consent from her before discussing the specifics of her case on this platform. I hope this helps. Tuberculosis, Malignancy."

As per their instruction checked the ultrasonography test, acknowledged us about the ovarian tumor and advised us for immediate operation. And we also checked the blood pressure, ECG , chest X-ray, thyroid, HIV test. Everything is fine except blood sugar and blood pressure. Now blood sugar and blood pressure are under control, physician also prescribed tablet Astyfer 400 for pressure and Insulin for blood sugar applying for 4-6-4 units BB-BL-BD per day, it is running since 10 days.

But one thing is that there is nothing I found like ovarian tumor or something like that in USG attachment removed to protect patient identity. I have seen all the reports except first which is not loading. Because menses normally ceases at around 40 to 45 years of age or sometime it may extent up to 48 to 50 years of age. So if your mother is menstruating up till 52 years of age with USG suggestive of fibroid uterus with adenomyotic changes, your mother must have remove her uterus and send for examination that whether there is carcinoma or not. And if not then nothing to worry. And if positive then may need another operation or chemotherapy. In your mother is case if carcinoma is there, there is more chance that it would be endometrial carcinoma or adenocarcinoma of uterine muscles. I do not know how there is a doubt about ovarian carcinoma. And if there is chance or good reason for suspecting than than your mother must have to do CT scan of abdo pelvis and some other blood test also. Rest of the test which are done is prerequisite for operation. Mostly they will remove ovaries also along with the operation at the same time. Because there is a chance of ovarian carcinoma in future. And during past life and at 52 years of age there is also no role of ovaries remain. Before operation your sugar level and blood pressure should be under control so what they are giving you. And physician fitness andor anesthetic fitness will required before operation. So better to get it done as early as possible. It is because if there is endometrial carcinoma also than why to give it a chance to grow. It is better that you remove it on first place."

        "output": "Hello. After going through your detailed and insightful query, I am of the opinion that you had one episode of cluster headache. I like to inform you that cluster headache affects mostly middle-aged men. Its cause is unclear but may relate to a vascular headache disorder or a disturbance of serotonin neurotransmitter mechanisms. Usually, there is no family history of headache or migraine. Episodes of severe unilateral periorbital pain occur daily for several weeks and are often accompanied by one or more of ipsilateral nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, lacrimation, and redness of the eye. Episodes often occur at night, awaken the patient, and last for less than two hours. Spontaneous remission then occurs, and the patient remains well for weeks or months before another bout of closely spaced attacks occurs. During a bout, many patients report that alcohol triggers an attack, others report that stress, glare, or ingestion of specific foods occasionally precipitates the attacks. In occasional patients, typical attacks of pain and associated symptoms recur at intervals without remission. I hope this helps."

Whether deep kiss or smooch can transmit the virus.",
        "output": "Hi. I will answer your query specifically. In your case, the chances of false negative are almost nil. Chances of false negative are high during the window period which extends from three weeks to six months. Usually, a person having HIV has detectable antibody levels by a month. Almost 97 percent of people become seropositive by three months. By six months any person having HIV will develop antibodies. Only a few cases have been reported where seroconversion occurred late after a year. As you have done your tests at monthly intervals till six months and the results have been negative, chances of it being false negative are almost negligible. You do not need any other tests. We consider three months as conclusive but prefer to do a test at six months too. If you have used a condom, you need not worry. If only sex is unprotected chances of spreading through single contact are 0-1. Kissing does not spread infection. I hope this helps."

        "output": "Hello. I understand your concern. Trench mouth or acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis ANUG is a bacterial infection and is uncommon nowadays but it is highly associated with HIV infection and in kids with nutritional deficiencies. To be diagnosed with trench mouth or ANUG, symptoms like gum necrosis and ulceration, pain and bleeding on just touching the gums should be present. The main characteristic feature is fetid or the putrid odor which is caused due to the rotting gum tissue. And people diagnosed with ANUG has this odor, unless if they are under treatment in a very initial stage. It is certainly difficult for people with ANUG to eat a portion of normal or even less spicy food if they are not under treatment. It is treatable within a week by the usual antibiotic regimen and medicated mouth rinses. Gum infection such as this cannot occur only by fellatio. If your partner is diagnosed with immunocompromised diseases, respiratory infection, poor nutrition or has the habit of smoking, practice caution during the act. Proper protection and oral hygiene practices will prevent such infections. I hope this helps."

It is better to attempt weight reduction if possible before achieving pregnancy. Irregular periods, if it is between 25 and 35 days normally it does not affect the pregnancy, as such cycles are generally ovulatory. The black marks are less likely to be due to fungal infection. Those generally indicate insulin resistance in obese individuals. They may disappear slowly once you lose weight. Itching is not normal, need to check once with a gynecologist to rule out infection. Normally, foods are not known to affect the chance of pregnancy. Just do not take an overdose of nutritional supplements, as it may affect baby if you conceive. Slight rise in temperature normally occurs due to the hormonal effect and is considered normal. Slight pain after intercourse is no problem and needs no treatment. Traveling in a car or jumping does not affect pregnancy. Just do not try vigorous exercises in the first three months of pregnancy. Normally, semen leaks out after intercourse and there is nothing to worry, as what leaks out is generally plasma, sperms normally go into the uterus immediately after deposition in the vagina. Still, if you are worried, you can keep one or two pillows below your hip to keep the semen inside for the longer duration. Apart from those answers, we normally do some tests for women who are trying for pregnancy. Those are hemoglobin, random blood sugar, TSH thyroid-stimulating hormone, Rubella IgG to know immunity against rubella, HIV, HBsAG surface antigen of hepatitis B virus. You can get those done if interested. These are to safeguard your baby. I hope this helps."

        "instruction": "Hello doctor, I had two sexual encounters with women whom I do not know their HIV status. Both were vaginal and a condom was worn. In the fourth and fifth weeks, I had a fourth-generation antibody-antigen test performed and it came back negative. Should I be retested again.",
        "output": "Hello, Welcome to icliniq.com. It is a good idea to get repeat testing, here is why. The antibody testing at the fourth and fifth weeks can give you some idea of the HIV human immuno deficiency virus status, but the one at 12 weeks after the exposure will confirm the negative status completely. The reason being the window period. The window period is a duration where a person can have HIV but still test HIV negative. The fourth generation is antigen-antibody based testing and the best we have so far for screening. When suspected acute HIV infection or high risk exposure, PCR polymerase chain reaction is the best in the fourth and fifth weeks post-exposure. Of note, the window period for a fourth-generation antigen-antibody test is short as compared to other HIV tests available about four weeks. Usually by this time, 95 of infection will be detected in the blood. In general, there is a three month window period for HIV after a given exposure, and therefore for the fouth generation testing to confirm that a person is more than 99.9 infectious. Hence the 12 weeks retesting is recommended. I hope this helps."

Warts can develop even years after the infection is acquired, therefore it is never really possible to know whether you are infected or not unless you develop a clinically visible lesion. Since you never had any visible growths or warts on the genitalia during all these years, therefore, it is likely that you are free of infection and never even acquired it in the first instance. Regarding the risk of cancer, only certain types of HPV e.g HPV type 6, 11, 16, and 18 are associated with an increased risk of cervical cancer in females, and not in males. In females, PAP Papanicolaou smear can be performed every year to look for any atypical cells.

I often do sense inside my head, i.e., pricking with pins and needles and flu-like symptoms all the time. The reasons for the above-mentioned problems are due to unprotected sex with a creature dog. Under the heavy influence of an alcohol, such a blunder was committed. I have an apprehension of contracting rabies from that encounter. Can rabies be sexually transmitted.  Please suggest me what test should I need to do to rule out the above-mentioned symptoms. I have great hope in you as you are one of experienced and best doctor cum pathologist. Please advice me the test so that I can perform the test and revert it to you for treatment.",
        "output": "Hello. Rabies can spread sexually but your symptoms do not classically point towards rabies infection. The neurological symptoms like confusion, nausea, excess salivation, etc., are missing. So the chance of rabies is less as per my opinion. However, for rabies, testing multiple samples like saliva, spinal CSF fluid, etc., like examination are needed. You can rule out leptospirosis by serological ELISA testing as you have a history of sex with the dog. There are many zoonotic diseases which mean those infections which spread from animal to human. HIV also can be ruled out by ELISA testing. So your detailed evaluation is needed to do further work up. For primary work-up, you can investigate as follows. Blood pressure measurement, serum all vitamin B estimation, SGPT, SGOT, urea, creatinine estimation, ESR, full CBC, serum ionized calcium estimation, serum vitamin OH D estimation. You can revert back with reports. For your detailed physical examination, you need to consult nearby internal medicine specialist."

        "instruction": "Hello doctor, I am a homosexual and this is my second time of having anal sex. It has been three weeks my partner had ejaculated inside of me, and then only I heard about peritonitis. I was wondering whether I was exposed to it or will it harm me.  I heard that it may lead to death and if so, how long do I live.  Additional information will greatly be appreciated.",
        "output": "Hello, Welcome to icliniq.com. Well, precautions first - While there is absolutely nothing wrong medically in your sexual orientation, irrespective of the legal status in your state, it is definitely not advisable to have unprotected intercourse with anyone. Even the use of condoms only ensures 95 protection. So in the future, always use a barrier like a condom before intercourse to ensure your own safety and your partner is safety. Not only you could get infected with a venereal disease like syphilis, genital warts, etc., you may get infected with the deadly disease called AIDS acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. Though there are effective treatments for most of the STDs sexually transmitted disease, why risk it in the first place. Now coming to your question. Peritonitis is the inflammation of the membranous lining which covers our abdomen and the pelvic area called peritoneum. It gets infected only if there is direct contact of some infected fluid with it and for that, it should have been perforated i.e. ruptured. It often happens when the intestines get ruptured due to typhoid fever, or due to a ruptured peptic ulcer of the stomach or intestine or as a result of trauma. In men, there has never been a case to the best of my knowledge, where a sexual act has resulted in peritonitis. It cannot happen unless the sexual force has been so vigorous that it resulted in the rupture of the rectal or anal mucosa. Even if it happens rarely because of this, peritonitis has very prominent symptoms like severe pain in the abdomen and you would have needed to be hospitalized. So do not worry. If you are fine and eating well with no pain in the abdomen, your previous coital acts have not given you peritonitis. And you may expect a normal life. Of course, you are risking your life by being at a risk of acquiring deadly STDs like HIV-AIDS, which are killers. So do not worry about peritonitis, but worry about STDs and follow precautions."

        "instruction": "Hello doctor, I had unprotected intercourse three times with an unknown woman. After 20 days, my symptoms started with stomach cramps and diarrhea. My endoscopy report shows acute superficial gastritis. But my CBC test was fine. Doctor prescribed medicine, but it did not help. Day by day, I became tired all the time, I am having a rash, oral yeast infection, and diarrhea. After two months, a gastroenterologist checked my CBC, stool, urine, HIVcombo, Hepatitis B and C, and serological test. All were negative. But the doctor did not understand what my problem is. But I always thought that I may be affected by HIV. After three months again, my HIV Elisa combo antigen and antibody test came out negative. But I am very much tired, and diarrhea persists with stomach upset. After five months, I consult an HIV specialist doctor in the ART center that time my rapid antibody test again was negative. But this time, my CBC report shows an infection. HIV specialist told, my CBC shows an infection, but it is not specific for HIV. May be I have another infection. After seven months again, my HIV ELISA antibody test came out negative. After nine months, I was tested for STD pannel such as Hepatitis B and C, CMV, H. Pylori, VDRL, Herpes virus 1, and 2. But all the results were Negative. Now, after one and half years, my HIV and antibody test is negative. But I always think I am infected with HIV because I have symptoms, and medicine is not helping me. So I am planning for the HIV PCR test now. My question is  1 What is the suspicious cause of this problemgastritis with diarrhea.  I guess my problem is sexual infection. Before this, I never faced these problems, and it has not happened due to my lifestyle and food habits. 2Is my HIV test conclusive for HIV.  3I do not have IBS. Only HIV, HBV, HCV, TB cause these symptoms or another virus can also lead this sickness.  4Advice me for more tests to rule out the reason for sickness.What can I do now.  Please help.",
        "output": "Hello. I read your query and understand your concerns. First of all, I feel there is neither HIV nor any sexually transmitted infections. This is because repeated tests without any evidence of infection are enough to tell that there is nothing concrete in this regard. Now coming to your questions. 1. The most likely cause of your problem is stress. You might be aware that stress affects your gastrointestinal system severely and can cause a variety of symptoms, including stomach ache and loose motions. 2. Yes, it is conclusive 99  although PCR will make it 100. 3. The chronological association between the stress after unprotected sexual encounter and development of gastrointestinal symptoms indicates the virus are not the cause including HIV. 4. I think you need to see a mental health professional for a possible diagnosis of hypochondriasis and relevant treatment. There is no test to diagnose hypochondriasis other than the interaction with a mental health professional. I hope this helps."

The doctor gave me 10 days Ciprofloxacin. Last month I had unprotected sex. About six days later I had a sudden strong tingling in my scrotum that stopped me in my tracks. I had a chlamydia and gonorrhea urine test a few days later but was urinating so frequently that I could not hold my urine at least an hour before the test, and the test was negative. Frequent urination continues till today. I also had Keflex last month, a full panel STD test this month, and everything was negative. But wondering if the antibiotic mixed with me filling up the cup way more than 30 ml could skew the test.  I did contract genital warts, most likely from this encounter showed up three weeks after.

Also, my lower back by my spine hurts, but does not feel like a kidney thing. It hurts for a bit. Wondering if a spine injury could affect my urinary system. I guess even though I took two chlamydia and gonorrhea test, I am paranoid that the two negatives may have been skewed from urinating too soon before on test one and being on antibiotics or providing a large volume of urine on test two. And the partner is of medium risk. She has no symptoms. The urine test was done with the Aptiva Combo 2 RNATMA test. There is no discharge, just this persistent urination and unable to empty bladder.",
        "output": "Hi. I have noted your concern. I do not think that the tests for gonorrhea or chlamydia would have been affected due to a higher volume of urine or oral antibiotics as the urine test relies on the detection of the nucleic acid material of gonorrhea or chlamydia which would have been present. Your symptoms could either be due to urinary tract infection or they could be those of prostatism. I suggest a urine routine microscopy, urine culture sensitivity, PSA prostate-specific antigen levels, uroflowmetry and pelvic ultrasound to estimate the size and volume of the prostate.

Sometimes during afternoon time, my body temperature raises up to 37.2 degrees centigrade. The sore throat was mild but was a one pin point like feeling. The phlegm had blood stains. Phlegm was green or yellow in color. I went to the doctor and he checked chest x-ray and found no problem. I tested HIV 3rd Generation antibody test after 19 days of exposure, which was negative.

How accurate is my 19 days HIV test result.  Can sore throat without fever can be a symptom of ARS.  I have only sore throat and very mild joint and muscle pain and that too not constant.",
        "output": "Hi, Welcome to icliniq.com. Based upon your history, my answer to your questions 1. Are My Symptoms Related to ARS.  Acute Retroviral Syndrome ARS typically begins 7-14 days after the exposure to a HIV positive patient, and may last for up to 3-4 months. The symptoms are typically flu-like with fever may be high grade or low grade, fatigue, headache, aching muscles or joints, sore throat, swollen lymph glands and sometimes a maculopapular rash. Now, this is simply a description of ARS, this does not prove that you have it Let me dissect this issue a little closely for youa The failure rate of condoms may be up to 5, and since you are not sure of it being torn, there is a definite likelihood that it may have ruptured. However that still does not ensure you acquiring the infection. Because HIV acquisition has so many issues - the CSW in question should be positive and more likely to spread it if she had symptomatic AIDS with high viral titres. Thus, there is no way of accurately assessing your risk of acquisition of the infection. I would recommend that instead of teasing your mind about YES or NO, get the tests done mentioned below to get over your anxiety.b Though your symptoms are similar to ARS, by all means these are also the symptoms of the following diseases. So, unless we get the tests done, we may not be sure. There are other STDs Sexually Transmitted Diseases related, that have a similar clinical picture . Herpetic gingivostomatitis and pharyngitis caused by Herpes Simplex Virus, a sexually transmittable disease, and rarely gonococcal pharyngitis another STD, in which urethral pus filled discharge is additionally, but not always seen along with sore throat. The third possiblity is of course a normal viral fever caused by simple viruses like adenovirus, coronaviruses etc., which may transmit from anyone to anyone, simply due to kissing. Let us hope you have the last type of fever that subsides without any complications.Your picture is non-specific and does not suggest any infection related condition. 2. Is There Any Possibility for Transmission of HIV Through Deep Kissing.  Kissing per se is not known to transmit HIV, except for few doubtful cases reported in medical literature. Of course deep throat kissing may have a little higher risk. The possibility will depend on the HIV status of the CSW. 3. What Can be the Cause For Blood Stained Phlegm.  If you have been trying to clear your throat vigorously to get rid of the phlegm, the severe blows on the throat may also lead to mildly blood-tinged sputum. The other cause may be Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia, commonly seen in patients with HIV-AIDS. However, it is just a rare possibility. 4. An ENT specialist had told me that the partition of my nose is a little bent. Is there any relation of this and my symptoms.  ENT specialist may have diagnosed DNS Deviated Nasal Septum. It might be a cause for recurrent sinusitis and occasional epistaxis bleeding from the nose, none of which is your primary symptom. So it seems to be totally unrelated. 5. I am feeling a little weak but I think this is mostly because of anxiety. Weakness may be a part of the viral fever which you have, with additional component of anxiety induced lethargy. No harm in taking Giloy Amla Juice twice a day 10 ml and tablet Septilin twice a day for a month. Get your Complete Blood Count CBC and Liver Function Test LFT done. In addition get serological tests for hepatitis B and hepatitis C done. Very few people know that the possibility of transmission of these infections along with or even without HIV is decently high in sexual encounters. 6. How accurate is my 19 days HIV test result.  It takes up to 12-16 weeks for HIV antibodies to become detectable by ELISA test. Thus your HIV ELISA test, though being accurate depending on the lab you got it done, is still not an indication. It simply suggests that you are not seropositive for HIV at present. A repeat test of HIV ELISA, 3 months after the day of intercourse and then once again at the 6th month is the standard practice of confirming or ruling it out. However, in today is era we have early diagnosing blood tests which may detect HIV infection even before ELISA turns positive. These tests include So I will advise you to get the above tests done to have the peace of your mind.If at all God forbid, your report for ARS comes positive, there are Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapies HAART available, which may be started soon after the tests detect the infection. The details of that may be discussed in our next consultation once I have your reports. But do not lose hope, because modern medicine is capable of salvaging your condition and all this is based on the premise of you having ARS, which has not even been proven. 7. Can sore throat without fever can be a symptom of ARS.  I have only sore throat and very mild joint and muscle pain and that too not constant. I have answered this query for you in the discussion above. The Final List of Tests to be Done 1 For HIV-ARS 2 For related STDs 3 General Tests - CBC, LFT.

The answer to so-called your problem of masturbation is stop thinking it as a sin. Think in line of science, not in the line of religion. Masturbation is nowhere different from sex and multiple benefits over sex like no risk of sexually transmitted diseases.

Second, the rash appears to be localized and not related to HIV or contact, it indicates local allergic reaction attachment removed to protect patient identity. It resolves automatically or uses tablet Cetirizine. Third, black tongue, not sure by pictures, if any, can be due to Nevirapine, which can give that and please specify the drug in PEP. Finally, using PEP after exposure is very good and it nullifies any risk. There are no known cases of getting HIV, post PEP use. So, continue PEP as advised.

Your CRP value mildly increased which will fall within range once inflammation resolution occurs. Allergic rhinitis probably might be the cause. The irritable bowel syndrome and tension headache are associated with anxiety. So you need to treat anxiety with anxiolytic medicine and with SSRI selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor group of drug for few months along with counseling.

        "instruction": "Hi doctor, I have been very worried about my health lately. I would like to preface this by saying that I have been experiencing anxiety off late and I have a suspicion that some of these symptoms could be related to that. I am currently weaning off of Prednisone, which I have been taking for an allergic reaction. I have noticed slight depression and a lot of fatigue as a result. I also quit using smokeless tobacco about 10 days ago, after about nine years of use. I am currently using nicotine patches but, they are very low dose compared to what I was used to. The patches are about 10 mg of nicotine per day. Also, one last thing, about three months ago, my doctor put me on Zantac 150 for acid reflux. I also had an EKG, chest x-rays, and blood tests and everything came back normal. I am not sure if all of this matters but, I just want to be thorough. Now, over to my main concern. I randomly had an allergic reaction to Advil about a month ago. I had swollen lips and hives. So, my doctor put me on 50 mg Prednisone for five days. This, along with my recent acid reflux diagnosis, had really started to give me anxiety about my health. A few days after I finished the Prednisone, I had a very strange experience in which both of my lips went completely numb. I immediately went to an urgent care center for treatment. The doctor thought that it could be related to the previous allergic reaction and put me back on Prednisone, but this time on a taper such as 60 mg for three days, 40 mg for three days, and 20 mg for three days. The lip numbness faded and only lasted for an hour or two. At this point, I had become very stressed and started wondering if the lip numbness could be related to oral cancer due to my smokeless tobacco use. So the next day, I went to the dentist to get a checkup and an exam. He checked my lymph nodes in the neck area and inspected the insides of my mouth. There were no white patches or lesions or sores or any visual sign of oral cancer. Through all of this, I had still been experiencing the tingling in the lips which kept me worried. It only happens occasionally and never lasts, which made me think that it could be anxiety. Then, about three days ago I noticed that I would randomly get a feeling of a lump in my throat, which I know can be caused by many things including acid reflux but, oral cancer is also one of them and this made me even more worried. This only lasts for a few hours each time and goes away. In fact I have only noticed it twice. I tend to take a Zantac 150 when I feel it. What is currently causing me worry is a constant tingling under my chin, in the area in the front of my neck. It is not painful but it is rather uncomfortable. It feels like someone is constantly lightly rubbing a feather against my neck. I am constantly checking my lymph nodes as I am paranoid at this point but, there is no visual sign of swelling. Can this be caused by stress or anxiety.  I will say that my mind has been absolutely consumed by the thought of oral cancer over the last couple of weeks. I feel like I may be over-thinking things and causing myself a tremendous amount of stress and anxiety. I have a history of panic attacks and anxiety, although I have never been on medication for it. I do not have any pain in my tooth, mouth, or jaw otherwise. I also recently sent an image of the floor of my mouth to an oral surgeon here because I was paranoid and thought it was whiter than usual, but she said that it was absolutely fine. Sorry for the long question. I guess I just really want to know if these symptoms I am feeling are something real or just anxiety. As I said, I have been healthy my whole life and these recent problems have been very stressful for me. I would hate to keep bothering my doctors for something that is not even there.

        "output": "Hello. There might be a small tear in the anal region, which is commonly called as an anal fissure. Even a small fissure can be really painful as it causes a spasm of the anal opening. It heals slowly, as it gets irritated repeatedly during the bowel movement. You might even notice blood on the toilet paper or in the stools. I suggest you get examined by a physician. Warm water sitz bath, which involves sitting in a tub warm of water, to soak the painful anal area, helps a lot in this condition. The other recommendation is to take a high fiber diet. Your physician, after an examination, can prescribe you analgesics and a stool softener. Hold off on more anal sex until you recover from the current problem. Hope your query is answered.

        "output": "Hello. I can understand your concern. Yes, you may have sperm allergy, that can be easily found by using a condom. Next time use a condom during sex and check whether you have discharge after that. Other cause can be due to 1. Gonorrhea and chlamydia are two of the most common causes of vaginal discharge, early diagnosis and antibiotics will help you. 2. If there is urinary tract infections with increased frequency of urination, irritation during urination, lower abdominal pain then urine culture will help to diagnose these conditions. 3. Urethritis is damage to the urethra from intercourse or masturbation, irritation from a product such as soap, deodorant, or detergent, and it can also occur due to adenovirus, and genital injuries. 4. Candida infection can also cause watery discharge with itching. Smear from the discharge will help you diagnose and start early antifungal medication. 5 Trichomoniasis infection sexually transmitted infection caused by a parasite can cause vaginal discharge too, and it can be diagnosed by swab or urine sample. I hope I have answered your query. If you have further doubts, I would be happy to help you."

The HIV-1 RNA qualitative TMA assay is recommended for use as part of a multi-test HIV-1HIV-2 screening and diagnostic algorithm. This assay can also be used to resolve indeterminate HIV-1 antibody assay results, and to test for HIV-1 infection in patients less than 2 years old. When a fourth generation HIV multi-test screening and diagnostic algorithm is used, if the test results include a repeatedly reactive HIV-12 antigenantibody fourth generation screen, followed by negative confirmatory tests for HIV-1 and 2 antibodies and HIV-1 RNA by TMA, the most likely interpretation is a non-specific biological false positive reaction in the fourth generation screening assay. There is no current laboratory evidence of HIV infection. Repeat testing on a second specimen is not generally indicated but may be appropriate if there are known risk factors for recent HIV exposure. If the recent HIV-2 infection is suspected, additional testing by HIV-2 DNA or RNA, qualitative, real-time PCR should also be considered. Can someone explain this to me.",
        "output": "Hi. HIV RNA PCR test is accurate after 9 to 13 days after the risk exposure. It can be used to detect early infection with HIV when most other screening tests are not yet reliable. However, it is not a confirmatory test and an early screening with RNA PCR should be followed by a more sensitive and specific screening test, this is the fourth generation antigen-antibody HIV screening test at four weeks and at 12 weeks. Therefore, RNA PCR is quite useful in the detection of early infection. Other times this test can be useful as a second test after an indeterminate fourth generation HIV screening test or when a positive HIV screening test is followed by a negative confirmatory test usually a western blot. In the second scenario, if RNA PCR turns up as negative then it suggests that an earlier positive screening test was most likely a false positive."

Secondly, the likelihood of getting gonorrhea and other infections which you mentioned are very unlikely after three months. If you had developed gonorrhea, there would be discharge or bumps over the penis within one month. About oral HPV, if your sexual partner had this infection, then there is a possibility of transmission, but that too is very unlikely. If you had developed, you would have symptoms by now. There would be at least minute warts that would have appeared over the oral cavity or genitalia. So, do not get tensed. Be cool.

Initially, I was not alert because I thought the person was a friend of my friend is, but later I realized that he was a total stranger, who was acting weird and asking everyone in the nightclub for a kiss on the cheek. For some reasons, I kept thinking that this weird person had some sort of contagious disease and was just desperate to pass the disease to as many people as possible.

I stopped feeling tired after two days, but the runny nose has not completely stopped until today, which is four days later from the start of the symptoms. From my own knowledge and some researching, I learned that early HIV symptoms include flu-like symptoms.

From my memory, when he and I exchanged kisses on the cheek, his lips, and cheeks, as well as my lips and cheeks, did not have any open cuts or sores, so I have almost zero chance of HIV exposure.

        "output": "Hi. The replication of the virus has no relationship in the detection of the virus. If the virus is present in the body, the immune system will detect it, and start defending the body by producing antibodies. This procedure does not need any replication of the virus. It just needs a virus in the body. So, if the fourth-generation test is negative by three months and six months, then you are negative. No need to worry about them."

The ink was poured directly into the ink pot from a larger bottle, and he throws the ink out after each tattoo. He did not clean the gun grip. He did clean my arm before the tattoo was applied and again when he was finished, along with various points throughout the tattoo. He did have me lay down on a sheet which he washes between clients. He continuously applied Vaseline to my skin throughout the tattoo, which had already been used for another client. From any of the above, is there a risk for HIV.  Even though the needle was new, is there any chance of infection from the gun grip or Vaseline or even anywhere else in the process.  Around 4 days later, I had extreme fatigue, nasal congestion, muscle aches and weakness in my lower legs. After 9 days, the fatigue went away, but the nasal congestion and muscle ache stayed. After 15 days, the muscle aches switched to the upper portion of my legs and I started getting pain in my neck. At the time, I had on and off sore throat and headache. I have not had any fever.

        "output": "Hello. 1 Oral sex is a less risky activity, but, that does not mean that it is risk-free. 2 The likelihood of HIV transmission from a person with HIV to a non-HIV infected individual depends on the type of contact involved. 3 The risk of HIV transmission during oral sex, i.e., seminal or vaginal fluid with HIV finding it is the way in non-HIV person is more likely if there is associated inflammation, cuts, sores present, presence of an infection in throat or mouth which will cause inflammation. 4 Bad oral hygiene and taking ejaculate cum in your mouth is a bad combination which can turn your low-risk activity to high-risk behavior. 5 The risk of becoming HIV infected through unprotected oral sex is lower than that of the unsafe sexual act. 6 Studies have shown that if you are using condom consistently  and correctly, and if the condom did not break while the sexual act, HIV risk would essentially be nonexistent. 7 Skin rash, body burn, and flu can have multiple causes.

Present symptoms may be due to some other viral fever or viral gastroenteritis.

There are STDs like herpes in which subclinical shedding can lead to herpes, but that is more common in vaginal sex. I do not think you need to worry too much at this point if she is negative for tests. Some STDs take time to become positive in blood. So just to be careful please repeat HIV, HBsAg, HCV, VDRL after three months. Molluscum, HPV, pubic lice usually spread if there is active lesions, which I suppose were not there, so no need to worry.

Prophylactic medications can be given if the status of the partner is not known sometimes. Take care."

I was tested for HIV by rapid test at 10 and 15 weeks after exposure both negative, but have symptoms by week 9, and worse symptoms by the 13th week. Can I be calm with these results.",
        "output": "Hello. The symptoms of acute HIV infection appear relatively for a short duration and resolve within a few days. These can appear anywhere around two to six weeks. Your signs at nine weeks could be a coincidental finding, and there could be numerous causes for the symptoms. The tests performed these days for HIV are highly sensitive and specific and gives accurate results. Majority of the people who are infected with HIV develop antibodies by two to eight weeks. The literature says approximately  5  develop by three months. With your negative HIV rapid test at 10 and 15 weeks after exposure, you can surely relax and calm. However, there are recommendations, and I also suggest to my patients to repeat the HIV test at six months of high-risk exposure. I hope your query is answered, but if you still have any other question, please revert."

I am a very active gay man who had signs of syphilis, and my infectious disease doctor presumptively treated me by providing antibiotics before I was tested. He told me to get tested as soon as possible, but I have never done. Two days after the antibiotics, my symptoms went away I had swollen lymph nodes. I also experienced mild flu-like symptoms, which I understand, are common after syphilis treatment. So, I assumed it was syphilis and never got tested. Now I am worried that if I get reinfected, my doctor will not be able to tell. Should I be concerned.  Currently under Biktarvy for HIV. Please help.",
        "output": "Hello. I understand that you are concerned. But serological tests for syphilis do not work like this. There are tests which remain positive for a lifetime if you once acquired syphilis. I dont know what features you had of syphilis but to confirm you have it or not you need to go for the serological tests, 1. TPHA Treponema pallidum haemagglutination  remains positive irrespective of the treatment taken for lifelong in most of the cases. So if it is positive, it will indicate the disease. 2. VDRL venereal disease research laboratory titers decrease after taking treatment, might become negative after treatment. Usually used to monitor the treatment response. Eg. If titer decreases, fourfold treatment is working fine. Not of much use if you did not have baseline VDRL in the first place. Still, get these two tests done and revert as there is no point in assuming that you had syphilis or not without these tests first."

During the winter, one night we went to a restaurant in and after that we went to a bar for some drinks and then to a food store. I had not dressed appropriately for the cold weather and I had no hat or scarf and it was very cold. We ended up going to his place. Next thing, I was fingering him and we had oral sex. I started to masturbate but I am circumcised so it hurt without moisture. He gave me jerkins and I was behind him. I slipped inside him and he came off. Then we put on a condom and did anal. We did mostly cuddling. Then I pulled out the condom with no ejaculation. The next day, I developed a severe headache so I assumed it was from the alcohol. I was not drunk. The next day, I started to get burst of muscle and joint pains throughout my body mainly when I was indoors. I was caught up with my final exams so I ignored the pains. When the pain went on for some days I went to a sexual health clinic and did a full STD test. I got negative for HIV but for acute HIV I had to wait 10 days for all the results. I still had the pains and took no pills. The very next day, I had night sweat and chills. I got so worried that I went at 11 p.m. to a 24-hours pharmacy to buy painkillers. My fever went up to 104F. I took Tylenol then get a cab at 3 a.m. to go to the ER. The fever went down and I did not see the doctor until 8 a.m. and I only got a painkiller.The next day I saw my right leg looked slightly swollen. Since then, my fever has always been low and the muscle pain and joint pain was still present. I ended up rushing to other ERs for help. Two nights ago, the pain got to me when I tried to sleep. My arms, armpits, neck, collarbone, groin, legs were all paining. I got another HIV antibodyantigen blood test just two weeks after possible exposure and it came negative. I have been taking Ibuprofen every five hours to reduce the pain but I start to get breathing problems and my bladder area feels tender with pain in the upper right abdomen. I explained to my friend all my experiences but he was firm that he is negative. We did not have bareback sex and we used a condom. I have no diarrhea, cough, fatigue or rash. Is it possible that I have contracted HIV.  I only have sex two times per year without ejaculation. My friend tends to be more active.",
        "output": "Hello. Protected anal sex and fingering is safe and there is no risk of HIV human immunodeficiency virus. However, receiving unprotected oral sex carries a very low risk even though saliva is not considered infectious, provided he did not have oral sores or bleeding gums. You may wait for another four weeks for a repeat HIV 1 and 2 antigenantibody test. At six weeks it is considered conclusive of CDC Centers for Disease Control recommendation. Though I feel that your symptoms are perhaps due to the flu rather than a flu-like illness, you may continue with symptomatic treatment. For more information consult an HIV AIDS specialist online ."

With the unknown status of the sex partner, it is always advised to be careful and observe all the precautionary measures to avoid STDs transmission. I can see you are taking Trioday Tenofovir, Lamivudine, and Efavirenz and that is useful in preventing HIV from multiplying in the human body. If she was HIV positive, it might pose a risk of transmission in a situation like this. To be on the safe side, HIV screening is a good idea.

        "output": "Hello. Even though there is a higher than normal incidence of HIV infection in workers in the sex trade, the fact that you used a condom, does make the risk that you contracted the HI Virus very low and unlikely. In my experience, however, I have found that patients will only truly relax or have their concerns completely alleviated when they have themselves tested. A rapid HIV test requires a very quick finger prick that can be done almost at any primary health care clinic, and results are available within a few minutes. This will give you documented proof of your status and is the only way to put your concerns at rest once and for all conclusively."

About a week or so after the encounter, I experienced some health-related concerns, one after another.I got an eye stye, inside of the eyelid, which was little painful and irritating. It went away in a week. I got a boil, nearly an inch in diameter, in the lower abdomen, which subsided in a week. I also got a white area behind the wisdom tooth. This area was painful during the initial 3 to 4 days, then the pain subsided, and the white area started growing bigger. OPG and clinical examination suggested impacted wisdom tooth and trauma caused by friction of upper and lower wisdom teeth. So, I got both the wisdom teeth extracted.

Sometimes, I feel this trembling even while sleeping and hence, the sleep gets disturbed. During daytime, I also get uneasiness and shivering for hours after an episode of heart trembling. My BP after this feeling was a little bit high at 18085 mmHg and then it came down to 13585 mmHg. I went to a neurologist and took CT scan and Doppler of the neck to find for any blocks. Both the scans were normal. The doctor prescribed Rancil, a beta blocker 50 mg, Aspirin, sleeping pill 0.25 mg and Vertin. I hear some sounds in ears. I also had ear pain and giddiness due to ear fluid. The doctor told that such trembling feeling may be due to ear fluid imbalance or may be due to little blocks in blood vessels, which may not be seen in the CT scan. After I took the medicine for six to seven days, there was no such feeling. For the last three days, I stopped medicine, which was prescribed for 15 days. Yesterday night, I felt the same trembling at heart and the sleep was disturbed. Then, I took only beta blocker 25 mg half of the original prescription, Aspirin and sleep pill and I had a good sleep.

Both of these medicines are SSRIs though, and I read about it online that everyoneevery source says never to take them at the same time due to risk of serotonin syndrome. Today, after taking the Buspar, I felt cold and shivered constantly. I could not get warm and I was very sleepy. Now I am scared to take the night time dose of Buspar and Celexa. I would like to have a second opinion on the safety of taking these medications together. If it is not safe, can I take only one instead.  Which one would you recommend, the Buspar or the Celexa.  Thank you in advance.",
        "output": "Hi. You are not on too high a dose of celexa or buspar. However serotonin syndrome is not always dose dependant. I feel just the chills and sedation are too general to be indicative of serotonin syndrome. You should have some level of muscle rigidity, high fever, muscular contractions myoclonus to suggest that. In my professional opinion I do not have much faith in Buspar. Celexa is good enough as an antidepressant SSRI to eventually help you have a full remission of depression, anxiety and panic attacks. If I was your treating psychiatrist, I would have supplemented the celexa with clonazepam Klonopin on a as needed basis, between 0.5 and 1mg every 8 hours PRN anxiety. If you are feeling cold and shivering constantly you might need to see your PCP Primary Care Physician to urgently address if you have an active urinary tract infection and also have him check your thyroid function. In effect, I advise you to stop the Buspar for now. Hope it helps. Get back to a psychiatrist online for further help ."

        "output": "Hello. As per your complaints, it seems that you might have developed dependence on Benadryl. And it is quite possible that due to this dependence you might be having these symptoms. Benadryl is basically a Codeine-based cough syrup, which is an antitussive agent OTC over the counter drug used to suppress dry cough. Codeine is a psychotropic substance which belongs to opioid group which is known for its dependence producing properties. Hence, due to long-term self-medication codeine cough syrup produces physical dependence. In the absence of it, body will crave for it and will produce withdrawal symptoms in the form of body aches, restlessness, palpitations, sweating, rhinorrhea, lacrimation, agitation, perspiration, vomiting, shivering, yawning and rarely fever with visual disturbances. Hence, in your case there is a strong possibility that you might be having withdrawal symptoms. But to confirm that, you have to tell few more details, We can conclude whether it is of opioid dependence or not from the answers given by you to the above questions. If it comes out to be opioid dependence, then we have to start with substitute treatment for opioid in the form of either Buprenorphine or Naltrexone, along with symptomatic management.

        "output": "Hello. I have noted your concern. A handjob is not a risk. Saliva is not infectious unless it has blood contaminated from bleeding gums or open sores in her mouth. Anal rubbing without actual penetration is not a risk unless she had open weeping sores in the perianal area or anal rim.

My question is if I am lucky and the result shows HIV negative after the therapy, how often do I need to get antibody tested if luck showers on me and each time the result says negative.  And if PEP does not work properly and I am tested positive, how long can be my lifespan if I stay on medications.",
        "output": "Hi. The answers to your queries are For PEP post-exposure prophylaxis efficacy, adherence to the medications prescribed for PEP is the most important thing. PEP is really efficacious, To the best of my clinical practice, I have not seen any case of a patient who has completed PEP with complete adherence and then turned positive. There are recommendations to test at four weeks, three months and then at six months of last exposure. You need not be tested in between and if negative, no further test is required."

Notes given regarding this test are this is a chemiluminescent enzyme CLIA for simultaneous qualitative detection of antibodies to HIV 1 and 2. A negative result does not exclude the possibility of exposure to or infection with HIV 1 and 2. A positive result is not a diagnosis of AIDS. Supplemental testing such as immunoblot should be done for confirmation. Specimens containing mouse monoclonal antibodies or heterophile antibodies can give falsely elevated or depressed values.",
        "output": "Hi. In CLIA Clinical Laboratory Improvement Assessment test result, a value greater than 1 is considered reactive positive. Your result is 0.03, which is less than 1. Hence, it is non-reactive negative. In HIV Human immunodeficiency virus testing, it is very important to know how long it has been since your suspected exposure to infection.It can take up to 3 months from the time of exposure, for the virus to be detected in blood. If it has been more than 3 months since your suspected exposure, your result confirms that you do not have HIV infection. In case it is less than 3 months since suspected exposure, I advise you to repeat the test after 3 months of exposure."

        "instruction": "Hi doctor, 27 days ago I had protected sex with a girl, whom I knew only for 5 days and it was the first time. Also, we had oral sex also. During oral sex, I had no protection. Next day I started having pain on my testicles and my stomach. I was feeling weak the whole time, and after a week I gave urine and semen for culture. The urine culture was clean, and the semen culture with bacterium E. coli has been detected. It is worth mentioning that I am suffering from prostatitis and I have been diagnosed and treated for more than 3 years with almost the same bacterium, which I thought has been eliminated. Also on that day, we had sex 3 times within 5 hours and I am thinking whether the intensity of that might have brought back the E. coli or it was still there and it appears now. I do not know therefore this is my first question. Since the oral sex was not protected, can it be that she passed me the E. coli.  Or is it due to my prostatitis.  After my semen results, the doctor asked me to take Tavanic 500 mg once per day for one month. I am now on the first week, the pain is still there but comparatively less. I still feel pressure on the lower part of my stomach and also since the last 3 weeks I feel my stomach always full and not so comfortable. Can this be a side effect of the E. coli or something else.  I had no fever since then, and I did not lose my appetite, but I am feeling full. Apart from the E. coli that I need to finish my treatment, now I do have a fear whether I have been infected with any other STDs. If yes, the semen and urine culture should have normally shown something abnormal. Also, I have a fear if because of the oral sex, I might have been infected with HIV, could this be possible.  Should I do an HIV test.  If yes which kind of HIV test can give me a fast indication. Thank you.",
        "output": "Hi. Frequency of sex has nothing to do with E. coli bacteria Escherichia coli. Prostatitis is very resistant to treat, so it is not necessary that if you have taken treatment, it will not recur. Sometimes, you have to take 4 to 6 months of treatment for prostatitis. This is the main reason why you are still having the pain. Semen and culture usually do not cover all STDs sexually transmitted diseases and lower abdominal pain is a non-specific symptom and can be attributed to prostatitis. Yes, HIV human immunodeficiency virus can be transmitted through oral sex. So if you know the person, it is better to get her tested because if she is not HIV positive, then you need no testing. Nevertheless, you can go for HIV 1 and 2 antibody test by ELISA enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method and HIV RT-PCR reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. I hope the above information is useful to you."

        "output": "Hello. I will try to solve your query so that all your doubts are cleared. First, to get infected with HIV first your partner needs to be HIV positive. The chances of your partner being HIV positive depends on the type of partner. If your partner is a commercial sex worker the chances are increased as compared to others. Secondly, the use of any protection. If you are using condom definitely chances are lower. Thirdly, if there is a contact of your blood or fluid with the partners fluid. This means if you have any injuries prior or during sex and your blood get mixed with partners blood, there are higher chances. Lastly, even when all the previous points get fulfilled there my be a chance that you might not get infected. So by your explanation, you are at a lesser risk. Coming to your last queries. Tridot test has a window period of three months, that is, it gives HIV status of three months from present and not recent three months and fourth generation test has a window period of four weeks. So going by the chronology of events you are quite safe. I hope it solves your queries and I hope you become a little relaxed now. If you still have doubt I am always there to help you.

I made mistake to have unprotected sex with him. I am going to get married soon. I will decide my marriage according to my HIV test result only. Please answer my questions and give advice. Thank you.",
        "output": "Hi. Thanks for providing the clinical pictures attachment removed to protect patient identity. I would try to provide you with the best possible answers to your questions. The symptoms you have mentioned for example fever, general feeling of not being well, vague body aches may be a hint of acute HIV human immunodeficiency virus syndrome. They may also, in reality, be hypochondriacal that is due to stress and you are giving a lot of importance to them. The skin eruption that you mentioned and the pictures are suggestive of urticaria or hives. This may also see even as a response to mild fever or medicines that you may have taken or may even erupt in absolutely healthy people. Itchiness without any lesions in the groin area may be due to sweat, exacerbated by stress levels. The prominence of tongue swelling is nothing abnormal. They are the normal lingual papillae which mean that normal texture of the tongue present in all. When a person is psychologically stressed, often these normal tongue markings are interpreted as being abnormal. So, do not worry about this. Genital discharge you mentioned may or may not be normal. You must attend an STD sexually transmitted disease or STI sexually transmitted infection specialist to get yourself checked for the discharge, which may be a sign of urethritis - infection of the urethra. For this, a urethral swab or swab dipped in the discharge will be taken to rule out. Having said that, the possibility of acute HIV syndrome cannot be ruled out with 100 certainty based on these symptoms, although apparently, the chances are too low. Yes, you can contract HIV even from a single exposure. The risk is moderate, from being the passive partner and allowing unprotected intercourse and passage of your partner is seminal fluid into your anorectal mucosa. Further, your partner agreed to have been promiscuous himself. A rapid HIV test is just a modification of the standard ELISA enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay test. The only difference between rapid and standard HIV test is that the results are given out within 20-30 minutes of having given the blood sample in rapid test module whereas have to wait for a period of a week for the results in the standard test protocol. The more confirmatory test would be a western blot or p24 antigen assay or HIV RNA PCR. These tests can confirm or rule out HIV within a maximum of 12 days of the last suspected exposure. So, get them done to put your mind at peace. My final advice does not panic. Visit an STD-HIV specialist as soon as possible for evaluation of the genital discharge and request to get the fourth generation test done. Also, the additional blood tests mentioned below. Get back to us with the report of these tests and take treatment for urethritis, if it is confirmed. No need to panic even if your fourth generation test comes out positive for HIV. It takes an average of 10 years for HIV positivity to convert into AIDS syndrome. And with a healthy lifestyle, positive thinking and available anti-HIV drugs, most patients who have full-blown AIDS, are also able to live healthy in the present medical era. Have you been vaccinated for hepatitis B.  You must get tested for hep B and C and VDRL venereal disease research laboratory syphilis. If you have not been vaccinated for hep B, get vaccinated as soon as possible. Maintain good oral hygiene. Your tongue seems to be coated due to lack of oral hygiene. Use a mild cleansing mouth wash and also get your tongue swab tested for fungus. 1. Fourth generation HIV testing assay. 2. Western blot test. 3. Urethral discharge or urethral swab evaluation for gonococcal and non-gonococcal infections. 4. Additional blood tests - serology for hepatitis B HBsAg -hepatitis B surface antigen test and hepatitis C Anti-HCV - hepatitis C virus antibodies, VDRL. 5. Tongue swab for fungus. Always use protection in the form of condom for any sexual activity. Never trust any sexual partner about hisher promiscuous nature or HIV status."

        "output": "Hi. I have read through your query in detail. Please find my observations below. Myoclonus or muscle twitching is a known side effect of Sevoflurane use, and it is not a serious concern. Sevoflurane does not cause laxity of ligaments. Very common side effects of Sevoflurane occurring in more than 10  of patients are nausea, vomiting, hypotension, bradycardia, cough, and increased agitation. Common side effects occurring in 1 to 10 percent of patients are increased salivation, tachycardia, hypertension, laryngospasm, airway obstruction, breath holding, apnea, respiratory disorder, somnolence, dizziness, shivering, fever, hypothermia, headache, increased fluoride in blood, abnormal liver function test and abnormal blood glucose level. Uncommon side effects occurring in 0.1 to 1  of patients are dry mouth, arrhythmia, ECG abnormalities, increased sputum, hypoxia, wheezing, bronchospasm, hyperventilation, pharyngitis, hiccup, hypoventilation, dyspnea, stridor, hypoxia, asthma, crying, nervousness, confusion, insomnia, confusional state, syncope, hypertonia, taste perversion, asthenia, pain, fluorosis, increase in AST aspartate aminotransferase, increase in ALT alanine transaminase, bilirubinemia, increase in LDH lactate dehydrogenase, increase in alkaline phosphatase, hypophosphatemia, acidosis, hyperglycemia, increase in BUN blood urea nitrogen, increase in creatinine, glycosuria, albuminuria, amblyopia, conjunctivitis, urination impaired, urine abnormality, urinary retention, oliguria, pruritus, and rash. Rare side effects occurring in less than 0.1  of patients is malignant hyperthermia. Female hormones progesterone before menstruation and relaxin during early pregnancy cause joint hypermobility and ligament laxity.

I really think this is HIV but if it does not show up on a test I cannot get treatment. Or if this is not HIV what else should I get tested for.",
        "output": "Hi. As per description, you are more obsessed with HIV rather than the actual scenario. Any infection will have a remnant in the body, called the footprint of the infection. In case of HIV, the virus leaves its particles in the body, of which p24 is the core protein that protects HIV DNA. For HIV to infect human CD4 cells, it needs to break this core protein and release RNA material from the virus which passes to human cells and then further replication continues and the virus spreads through the body. So, we test for p24 particles in the body. If they are present, then you are infected and if it is not present, then you are not infected in any case even you highly suspect or think. So, the fourth generation detects, not just these particles but also the body is response to these particles, called p24 antibodies. So, if you are negative after three months by this test, then there is no chance of being positive with the exposure. You have to accept the truth. And coming to other conditions, lipodystrophy, check for the endocrine problem which may be a cause of low testosterone. All your complaints may have undiagnosed conditions but HIV is not at all the cause. Do not be obsessive, accept the truth that you are free of infection."

STIs are the diseases that are typically transmitted during sexual intercourse. It is unlikely to catch sexually transmitted infections with kissing alone, but with a few exceptions if the STI has manifested itself orally andor in oral fluid of that person. Hepatitis B virus can be transmitted through kissing as the virus is found in saliva and other body secretions of HBV infected person. Herpes infection- This can be transmitted through kissing with a person who has a visible cold sore. Human papillomavirus HPV or warts and syphilis are less likely to be transmitted through kissing.

I would, however, urge you to visit your local dermatologist or urologist for a visit, as a clinical exam is necessary to confirm the diagnosis. Regarding your burning sensation during urination, I would suggest you wait till you finish your antibiotics and if it persists, a urine examination would help to identify if there is any urinary tract infection."

I took HIV combo test CMIA method at 28th-day and the result came negative. Again on the 35th day and 41st day both were negative. Please suggest.",
        "output": "Hi. Following are the answers to your query Condoms are an excellent way to protect not only from HIV but also from other sexually transmitted infection STI and if you have used the condom correctly and it did not slip off or break, it is unlikely you contract HIV if your partner is HIV infected. It is always recommended to check the expiry date of it before using. Also at every time of sex, a newer condom should be used and water-based lubricants are always recommended with it. The risk of exposure is dependent on the length of time that had passed after the condom was initially put. No type of condom is 100  effective against HIV or for any STI, but if you and your partner are having sex, nothing protects better against these than a properly used condom. Using a latex male condom can greatly reduce but not entirely eliminate the risk of HIV or any other STI. You increase your risk of contracting HIV and for that matter any other STI if you have multiple partners. It is really good that your HIV test is negative on 28th, 35th and 41st day post-exposure. But, as per the recommendations, I still suggest repeat HIV rapid test at three months and if negative, then at six months. You need not repeat in between."

Regarding HIV infection, the window period or period in which a person might test negative for the virus but actually be positive because of a delayed immune response is typically between 21 and 60 days. There is however some evidence that it can be as long as 180 days six months. When there is a history of a potential transmission risk event, like having unprotected sexual intercourse, we recommend a final repeat of the antibody and antigen combo test at six months. Even though your symptoms could be explained by other infections, I would still recommend that you repeat the combo test at six months for your own peace of mind. It is also very important that you test yourself for syphilis as your symptoms, especially your rash, suggests a need to just exclude that, as it is highly treatable if found. I would strongly suggest as well that you consult with a trusted physician so that he or she can examine you clinically and help to exclude other diagnoses like upper respiratory tract infection and treat accordingly."

If the symptoms persist, further tests may be needed. For the headache, you could get your eyes tested. Also, get your blood pressure checked. You have asked for advice on HIV infection. HIV infection occurs in three stages. Stage 1 Occurs within 2 to 6 weeks of exposure. Symptoms include a headache, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, rash, cough and cold. It lasts for a couple of weeks, then goes away. Stage 2 There are no symptoms during this stage. Stage 3 Full blown symtoms of HIV occur due to immunity being compromised. It is important to use a condom as it provides the best protection against sexually transmitted diseases. If you are suspecting HIV exposure, it is important to get one tested. ELISA test is the method used for screening. Rapid HIV tests are also available. These are only used for screening and should be follwed by western blot test which is confirmatorty. Sometimes, a false positive result occurs so it is important to get a repeat testing done. HIV virus takes 2 to 12 weeks to appear in blood so that it can be detected by the test. A person should get their partner tested too if the result comes as positive. Please consult a nearby doctor if symptoms persist."

What I am anxious about is that my fiance got a tattoo done yesterday, unprofessionally it was done by a local tattoo artist in our village who gives tattoos at the artist is own home. My fiance had his parent is consent before he got this tattoo. But, young as we are, we are not yet aware of the risks of this unprofessional method of tattooing. This morning, my mother warned me about the risks of getting HIV through the tattoo.I am concerned because I was an eye-witness of the process, the artist just drafted the design with a pen. I saw the artist pour the ink from the bottle to a cup that has obviously been used before. I just found out today that new needles should be used, and I am troubled because I did not see the artist change the needles before he gave my fiance his tattoo. While tattooing the artist is wiping off the blood and extra ink off of my fiance is skin with wet cotton he just used tap water in a basin. Lastly, when the tattoo was done, he wiped Petroleum jelly over the area. Now, I am very anxious because months ago I found out that HIV and AIDS are very common in our area.These are my questions. Is it possible that my fiance might have acquired HIV through the tattoo process because of the unsterilized and reused equipment.  How high is the risk of him being infected.

        "output": "Hello. I understand your concern. Firstly, stop worrying. There is a solution to your problem. It is true that unsterile needles used for tattooing can lead to the spread of certain blood-borne infections. HIV virus is quite unstable outside the human body, so it is less likely for the virus to have been active on the needles, but we cannot rule out the chance of him acquiring the infection. HIV virus does not usually show up on blood tests very soon. The best thing to do is to talk to your doctor about the exposure and your fiance can take post-exposure prophylaxis. Some medicines will be given that will help to prevent infection in people who might have been exposed to the virus. There may be a risk of other blood-borne infections like hepatitis B, hepatitis C, tuberculosis or Staphylococcus aureus. These can be prevented by taking appropriate treatment. Please talk to your doctor. I hope that helps."

        "output": "Hi. As I can see that the episode is recent in time, I would suggest you use post-exposure prophylaxis PEP as early as possible within 72 hours of exposure. The chances of HIV transmission are related to the status of your partner and viral load of partner if she is positive. In general, transmission is very low that is 1 in 10000 contacts with protection, as I can see that there is a break in the condom, it is wise to start PEP. You need to wait at least two weeks for the tests and you can get fourth generation HIV test and DNA PCR test for confirmation."

On my annual physical 11 months back, my WBC was low. Three months back, my GP checked it again. WBC came back in range but platelets were low. Over seven years, platelets have been between 134 and 165. GP sent my CBC history to two oncologists for review of low platelets. One said do test for H.pylori, hepatitis c, and HIV. Did the tests, all came negative. Both the oncologists asked to follow CBC. My father died of multiple myeloma at age of 64. The other day, I noticed a small bruise on my hip. Probably no big deal but have a heightened awareness now. My question is due to my father dying of MM andor my CBC history, am I at a higher risk of blood cancer.  What or when should I be concerned, what to look for.  I certainly do not want to go to an oncologist with a single bruise.",
        "output": "Hello. Your CBC does not suggest multiple myeloma attachment removed to protect patient identity. In the case of multiple myeloma, anemia can be there and clinical symptoms like a constant headache, kidney system related symptoms, etc., can be present. But as your father was having a history of multiple myeloma, you are also at risk. But it does not necessarily mean that you will develop cancer in the future, the risk can be there but exact percentage cannot be predicted. So if you suffer from any unusual symptoms related to multiple myeloma like a headache, affected vision, weight loss, bone fractures, fever, etc., then you have to consult a nearby doctor for detailed evaluation. Your CBC is not showing any dangerous finding but still, I suggest you investigate with peripheral smear examination report and serum immunofixation electrophoresis for further work up. Peripheral smear examination will show any abnormal cells if present and electrophoresis will help in identifying monoclonal M band if present. You can revert back with that report."

        "output": "Hi. Burning sensation in the feet may be because of nerve damage, also called neuropathy. In most people with neuropathy, the leg nerves get damaged first. Damaged nerve fibers are more likely to be overactive and misfire, thereby sending the pain signal to the brain even though there is no wound. This is often accompanied by numbness and tingling sensation on the feet as well. Diabetes is also the most common medical condition that can cause burning feet. Other conditions that can cause burning feet are alcohol abuse, chronic kidney disease, HIV, vitamin deficiency, low thyroid level, drug side effects, peripheral artery disease, infection, and inflammation. Treatment of the burning sensation on the feet is to treat the cause and also to prevent further nerve damage and pain. More information about your symptom is needed so that a proper diagnosis can be made. Information needed to include how long you had the symptoms, how often do you have them, how bad is it, your lifestyle, if you smoke or drink alcohol, the medication you take."

Baby born premature, asthma, recurrent respiratory infections, repeated hospital admissions, on chronic medications, poor immune state nephrotic syndrome, TB, HIV, if swine flu is endemic in that geographic area. If the baby is healthy, no above risk factor, then you can exercise not to give. As flu is air born disease and kids are in general high-risk population, I would recommend. It will be safer to give."

Secondly, the home kit for HIV has a low sensitivity and low specificity. So, it is inconclusive. ELISA enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay is a standard test advisable for HIV testing. Since it is four months, the window period for acquiring an HIV infection has overlapped, and hence, having a negative report at this point is very sure to conclude as not having HIV infection. I would suggest you get tested for ELISA now and repeat it after four weeks again or after a month. Also get a swab sampling done for your throat pain and consult a physician."

Do they even check for O type.  Secondly, most testing kits as I saw on the net are using gp41and gp120 for the antigen. Is gp41 also common for O type or is it for M type only.  How to rule out O type infection.  Please help.",
        "output": "Hello. I have reviewed your query and here is my advise. As far as HIV infection is concerned, M strain variant of HIV1 is a common type. O subtype is very rare. However, let us move onto your question. Rapid diagnostic test and CMIA usually detect M strain of HIV effectively. However, depending on manufacture, a final comment can be given. But RT PCR usually detects all strain for HIV. Kindly mention after how much time of exposure you have investigated with RT PCR.  I am asking this question to rule out window period for HIV."

It can be due to anxiety, over-exercise, and due to less food intake than a requirement. You can rule out such common cause if it is present. If this is not the issue, then investigate with serum TSH thyroid stimulating hormone estimation to rule out hyperthyroid. You can do test for HIV using Elisa, and fourth generation testing if it is suspected. You can do a chest X-ray to rule out any lung problem if it is present. Any chronic infection can also lead to weight loss. So provide your history if it is present. You can consult a physician for a physical examination."

It was one day in school two months back where I just could not sit down because of my lower back pain and would go away about two days later and notice everytime I get out of the bed, I would have back pain in the spine area. I would say after that started going on, about two weeks later my tongue and fever popped up on my lip and form a white clear blister popped out and noticed my tongue got white and all my lymph nodes started to swell. The next day I felt my arms burn on and off and the right side of my groin throbbing but you can see it swollen there. I went to the first aid and they said it is an upper yeast infection and then I went to another and they said it could be cancer or HIV symptoms because of the white tongue and blisters in my throat. So I panicked and went to the hospital and they ran for HIV and it came back negative. I have to include that I took an OraQuick test for HIV and it came back negative. She came and told me that I had a viral infection and to drink plenty of water. Now, today I went to the health department for a full STD test of everthing for that as well. However, my result was fine and I had night sweats when I started taking medicine. And now that some of my lymph nodes are there on my left side of my neck and armpit, and the right side of my groin is throbbing but does not appear to be swollen. My mouth is tingling because of HSV1 and my finger are throbbing or jumpy but painless and sometimes become stiff.",
        "output": "Hello. First of all, you have to acknowledge that your STD tests and HIV OraQuick are negative so that there is nothing serious. You are 26 and if the whitish lesions were not there prior to sex then we can rule out cancer too. You are not in a high-risk age and cancerous lesion does not appear all of sudden. HIV has been ruled out already. The test came negative and your partner is safe too. The enlarged lymph nodes could occur even in candida infection too. Rest of the symptoms you have could be explained by active febrile illness most likely viral. You should get your CBC or complete hemogram done again. This will help in finding out infection. Continue to take anti inflammatory drugs for symptomatic relief. Tingling could be partially due to anxiety."

All the results came nonreactive. After a few days, I got sores inside my lips. So I was planning to take IgG test for HSV. Is tridot test taken for HIV is reliable.  Is there any chance to get gonorrhea and chlamydia after 100 days.  Is IgG test is reliable after four months.  Please advise.",
        "output": "Hi. Tridot test for HIV is reliable. There is something called window period in HIV. It usually ranges from two to three months where the test for HIV will be negative. In such cases, the test has to be repeated. Since you have done the test after three months, this test should be conclusive. VDRL venereal disease research laboratory test and HBsAg test hepatitis B surface antigen test are reliable. If they are negative, it means that you do not have an infection. Gonorrhea symptoms will start within two to five days of contact, and chlamydia comes within 10 to 14 days of contact. The chances of having gonorrhea and chlamydia after three months are minimal. For Herpes, you have to take both IgG and IgM antibodies test. IgG antibody indicates past infection, and IgM antibodies indicate present infection. If you have blisters, then IgM will be positive. If IgG alone is positive, it suggests about the past infection. I explain about pus cells also. Pus cells are polymorphonuclear leukocytes and neutrophils. There should be more than ten pus cells in the urine per high power field for the urine test to be positive. Having three to six pus cells are not of much significance. It should be more than 10 to be worried."

But may have casual sex with others. Generally, I would imagine that they too would be practicing safe sex with their regular boyfriends, then really I do not see statistically being any real chance of contracting HIV or any other STD. I too have had casual sex with a number of such girls. If I continue these activities with multiple partners of the same profile then chance of contracting HIV or STDs should be next to zero. Is this correct.  In two situations like condom coming out or breaking, but the sex act being stopped immediately, what would be the chance of my contracting HIV or any other STD.  What other immediate preventive measure should I take if the condom breaks or comes out other than stopping the act.  Should I take Truvada immediately.  If yes, for how many days should I take it to become effective.  Does it become effective from day one.  Can one take it few days before sexual intercourse and stop it in between and again restart it.  Do I need to do any blood test for HIV or other STDs in case the condom breaks or slips out.  If so, what are the blood tests that I need to do and with how many days gap.  Is there any STD one can get from skin to skin contact without genital contact.

        "output": "Hi. An unsafe sex increases the chance of contracting STDs sexually transmitted diseases as well as HIV human immunodeficiency virus. As you mentioned that the status of your partners are mostly not known, so this puts you in risk of contracting STD or HIV if you get involved in unsafe sexual practices with such partners. In case of slippage of condoms or breakage of condoms, puts you at risk, which cannot be neglected while having sexual intercourse. First and foremost important thing to do is, to stop the act and wash your genitals with mild soap under running water. Avoid applying any cream or lubricant that can cause irritation to genital skin. Besides this avoid promiscuous behavior. There is no need to take Truvada Emtricitabine and Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate until and unless you know the HIV status of the partner with whom you have had unprotected sex. Viral infections such as genital warts and herpes can be contracted by even skin to skin contact. For accidental genital contact, firstly get the STD profile done, and then if required start the treatment for the respective STD that is detected on testing. In your case you should use XL size condoms extra large, which can be procured from a medical store. Having an unprotected sexual intercourse with a partner who is HIV+ then there is always a risk of contracting HIV, you cannot neglect it or can take chance of not contracting HIV by having sex only for once with such person. If you are not sure about vaccination and as you are involved in unhealthy sexual practices then you should get your hepatitis B done. For further clarification consult a sexologist online ."

It started out in an acute way but is turning out to be chronic. It has been more than two and a half months and I am still suffering from it. FYI, my blood test is very clean and good. PFA. In the past two months, I have been using Bepozic tablet twice or thrice a day on a dermatologist is advice, but all I observed is that medicine is just soothing me a bit from having any itches but is not fighting with the root cause of it. For that reason, I keep getting this burning itching sensation again and again if I stop taking the medicines and on the other hand, I do not want to run myself on medication for months and years. I researched a bit online and surprisingly, found out that allopathy has no perfect cure for it but homeopathy does. That is the reason I wanted to try homeopathy treatment this time. Here are my following questions I read that homeopathy treatment takes a while to cure. So, can I use these Bepozic antihistamine tablets twice a day, so that I do not have to worry about itching.  Is it safe to use homeopathy medicines with other generic medicines like Paracetamol, Cetirizine, Benadryl, etc..

The doctor said it could be entirely reasonable for a woman to have a count of CD4 around 400. The reason for dropping maybe due to a previous infection and stress. I had no any infection previously, but a low-risk exposure to HIV eight months before and no further risks ever since. Last year, I had my first ever HIV test third generation antibody, which came back negative. I also had two more the same kind of test after that with negative results. Only recently, I am experiencing recurrent colds and blocked, runny nose, vaginal infections, fungi like discoloration on two of my fingers and red dots or spots, rashes on one of my shoulders.

However, below will give you a better idea of my story. Two months back, I had unprotected oral sex with a guy that lasted for about two minutes. He then penetrated me unprotected for about a minute in which I made him put on a condom. After we were done, he cleaned himself up and penetrated me again for about three minutes. Ten days later, I noticed I had a sore throat and dry cough with a very low temperature and immediately scheduled a visit with my doctor as I was really nervous. I had a slight fever and asked my doctor to perform an STD test. When I got my results back I tested HSV 2 positive. I thought I was fine as far as those results were concerned. However, I read that there was a window period that I needed to test. As time went on I started to have a very upset stomach, gassy, bloated and diarrhea. I am also lactose intolerant. So, I suspected that it was from that. It went away but today I have it again, however, I am taking Penicillin and I heard that this was one of the symptoms. I have a dry mouth which I also heard could be from the Penicillin as well. My period for this month is noticeably lighter than normal which I am freaking out about. I never got a rash or anything or that I noticed. About a week ago, my husband started having diarrhea with an upset stomach and I noticed a rash on his knee which looks more like a bruise than a rash. It was red and purple with no bumps and very small but had no other symptoms. I also noticed that I had a small lymph node in the neck which is the reason I am on the Clindamycin. I got nervous and decided to go back to the doctor so that she could test me for HIV again and the results were still negative. The lymph node has gotten smaller and stopped hurting, however, I do not see a stone or anything in my mouth that looks like a stone. Now my mouth is really dry not producing any saliva. This is my biggest concern. I also developed thrush. I have stopped taking any medicines so that I can see which medicine it is. Can you please give me some insight.",
        "output": "Hi. A fourth generation HIV duo test is considered reliable and conclusive if it is still negative after six weeks. Most STD sexually transmitted diseases specialists consider this six weeks gap as the upper limit of the window period for an HIV duo test result to be considered final. Since your exposure was two months back and your last HIV duo test was almost eight weeks after exposure, your test result is reliable and conclusive. You do not need to worry about HIV from that particular episode. For more information consult a HIV AIDS specialist online ."

        "output": "Hi. I appreciate that you are very much conscious and alert while having sex and take all preventive measures. 1. Kissing can spread some diseases only if the other partner is infected .These diseases spread through saliva . There are so many diseases which spread through kissing like mononucleosis, certain kind of viral infections and sore throat and some other. I guess you are much concerned about STDs Sexually Transmitted Diseases. HIV is present in saliva but till now no HIV case had been reported through kissing. But hepatitis B cases are reported and well documented and hepatitis A & C as well, so here I will advise you not to kiss women about whom you are not aware of their health status. 2. Herpes viruses are of many types and can spread through skin contact also. Here I think you are concerned with genital herpes virus which causes STD. This usually spreads via sexual intercourse but can also spread through body fluids like blood, saliva, oral sex without a condom if your partner is infected. 3. No, there is no vaccine available for herpes. But you must get hepatitis B vaccination done as it is a fatal disease. 4. If you are using lubricated condoms then no need to use a lubricant unless your partner is not comfortable without a lubricant. 5. Anal sex is usually not advisable as it can cause intense pain and injury inside your partner is anus and not safe for her. But if you insist and want to do, then apply a lubricating gel and can do at your own risk. 6. Washing genital organs after having sex is advisable.

However, once the wound heals, the risk falls back to that of normal skin as elsewhere. The risk for HIV in your case would be high only if you participate in intercourse when your genital herpes has not yet healed completely. It is advisable to abstain from all sexual activities for up to two weeks after an episode of herpes so that the infection resolves completely. You could continue to participate in sexual activities as normal people after two weeks. With the use of a condom, after the healing of the wound, your risk would be the same as any other person.

All your tests are correct and there is no need to get them repeated. For gonorrhea and chlamydia again PCR has been done, which is extremely reliable and can pick up even a few organisms if present in the body. Fourth generation HIV ELISA test has been done, which is very accurate and can pick up infection at very early stage. There is no need to repeat it. Anti-HCV hepatitis C virus antibody and HBsAg hepatitis B surface antigen done at 60 days is not confirmatory. If your physician suspects any symptoms, then you may get them repeated after three to six months. Viral load test for HCV and HBV are very accurate if done now and confirmatory, but are quite expensive. No other test required.

Does contacting environmental surfaces that contain HIV+ fluid like blood, etc. with current paper cuts in hand infect me.  Therefore, please answer my question regarding two things 1. Can I get infected from getting paper cuts from sharp things that contained HIV+ fluid like blood, etc. 2. Can I get infected with HIV from having contact with environmental surfaces that contain HIV+ fluid like blood, etc., with my finger that has been cut.",
        "output": "Hello. Please note the beveled edge of paper cut do not cause HIV infection as paper soak all blood within seconds and the paper is dry. In a dry medium, no HIV stays alive, so no HIV infection. Your second question is not at all having meaning as by touch no HIV is transmitted. It is not the way of transmission. Only sex or blood infusion or needle prick within seconds when drawing blood of HIV positive patient. So, do not worry. You are safe. No HIV infection is there."

Then remember that it is a natural response of our skin to heal or combat any trauma with hyper or hypopigmentation. In your case, there is hyper pigmenation. Leave it as such right now. Because any creams, if used right now, will start itching and redness. And your lesions are fresh so I do not recommend it right now.

Herpes 1 IgG positive indicates a history of herpes virus type 1 infection which is usually spread by oral contact and causes lesions in the facial region. Active lesions occur during periods of reduced immunity like other viral infections or sometimes spontaneously, rest of the time the virus remains dormant in the body. I would advise you to visit your local dermatologist for a further clinical examination and any treatment if necessary. Positive VDRL venereal disease research laboratory test must be taken with caution as there is a good chance of false positive. As the associated TP Treponema pallidum antigen test is negative, it is unlikely that you have syphilis. Though your HIV ELISA enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay is negative, if you have a suspicion of the possibility of contact then I would advise a repeat testing after six months without any unprotected contact just to be sure.

I noticed that it was done with a used blade, which was not cleaned properly. Is there a risk of an HIV or other viral infection due to this.  Please guide me.",
        "output": "Hello. The likelihood of HIV human immunodeficiency virus transmission, in this case, is 1 in 300. Firstly, you are not sure that the person, on whom the blade was used previously, was HIV positive. More importantly, HIV rarely survives in dried blood. So, in the case the person is blood was on the blade, it would have dried in 15 minutes. Hence it is less likely that the HIV would survive. In spite of all this, I would say precaution is the best. Always ask the barber to use a new blade. Also, the chances of getting a Hepatitis B and C infection are higher than that of an HIV. To prevent this, I suggest getting a Hepatitis B vaccine. Please consult your local clinic in case you experience any unexplained and non-recovering fever. If you are still worried, consult your local clinic and get an HIV test done after one to three months. For more information consult an internal medicine physician online -->."

Molluscum contagiosum is caused by a virus and this lesion presents with a central umbilication, a depression similar to that of the navel. A white body is present in the bump. It is a contagious and sexually transmitted infection which can spread and form new lesions. The treatment plan will be needling to extrude the material inside and TCA cautery.

A week after this, I started having gas in my stomach and feeling strange and this continues till today. Ten days after this exposure and after I drank a liter of milk, I had diarrhea. The next day I ate, 20 minutes later I went to the toilet. Since then, I did not have such problem but whenever I am eating something I have this feeling that I need to go to the toilet and my stomach is playing all over. But, I did not have any symptoms of diarrhea. Also, I never had a fever during this period. Five days ago, I started having a headache and my nose was full and I was coughing like I had a kind of virus and I did not know if it was correlated with my symptoms in my stomach. I still have the feeling that I need to go to the toilet but when I go, it is either the gas or the normal stool. On day 15 after the possible exposure, I went to a clinic and I had done an HIV third generation test and the result was negative. When I asked the doctor what kind of test was that he mentioned to me the third generation but enforced which is equal or better than the fourth generation and this is what the doctor told me. My worries are if I have been infected with HIV by performing fingering and only that, and if my symptoms are related to that and if not what else might be. I am going today to give a sample of my stool for culture to see if I have any virus or anything else. In two weeks from today, my wife and I have decided to do an in vitro fertilization and therefore I am worried if the above are interlinked and I need to take any other action. Finally, my other question is linked to the latter. If I will take any antibiotics now for my stomach if they find also something in my stool and in two weeks, I need to give semen for the in vitro fertilization is this fine or the antibiotics will affect the quality of the semen.  Should I do anything else with reference to my possible exposure to fingering.",

There is not even a need to screen for HIV if fingering is the only physical activity that you have performed. Your stomach issues are perhaps due to indigestion and lactose intolerance. Milk and dairy products are a common cause of lactose intolerance. You can avoid dairy products for a while. I do not see any issues with your scheduled IVF in vitro fertilization procedure.

In fact, herpes 1 is a very common infection almost everyone has gone through it. So, I do not think that your symptoms are related to these types of infections. In many cases, no cause of peripheral neuropathy is found idiopathic peripheral neuropathy.

        "instruction": "Hi doctor, My symptoms are as follows. Pain in the right testicle, swelling at the top of the right testicle and some redness on the urethra, especially after ejaculation. I had Chlamydia about 18 months ago. I was tested positive and treated with two antibiotic pills, which seemed to cure it. After six months, the test came back all clear. They also checked for syphilis, gonorrhea, and HIV. All came back negative. Syphilis IgG or IgM by EIA - negative, HBsAg - negative, hepatitis C antibody ELISA 3rd generation - not detected, HIV 1 and 2 ABS or P24 antigen screen - not detected, Chlamydia trachomatis DNA PCR - not detected, N.gonorrhoeae DNA PCR - not detected, Mycoplasma genitalium DNA PCR - not detected, Ureaplasma species DNA PCR - not detected, Trichomonas vaginalis DNA PCR - not detected, Gardnerella vaginalis DNA PCR - not detected and herpes simplex type III DNA - not detected. Six months ago, I started to experience the symptoms. When I went to the doctors, they gave me a 9-day course of Doxycycline as they suspected epididymitis. It seems to clear it up in about five days, and I was even cycling and running again. A week after the course of Doxycycline, the symptoms came back. I read on the internet that the bacteria, which can find itself in all sorts of places as the tubes in the testicles can be like a network of caves and it can be hard to kill off completely. I visited the sexual health clinic. They gave me a 14-day course of Ofloxacin, which slightly reduced the symptoms. They seemed reluctant to rerun a Doxycycline course as they said it came back after taking it the first time. Do I need a long-term course of Doxycycline to work really.  I had an ultrasound scan to reveal that I had an epididymal cyst, but currently, there is no pain. The doctor advised it would cause no harm and I would have to live with it. It is about the size of a pea. Over the last few months, the epididymal cyst and redness remain on the scrotum in that area and slight rash or redness on the penis glad. The urologist put me on six weeks of Cipro, which seem to lower the irritation and symptoms by 60 , but never really cleared it up. Then, I have had a urine culture test, and it came back with the following. Please note the following antibiotics Augmentin, Cefpodoxime and Ciprofloxacin should not be used as the first choice if alternatives are available. Urine culture more than 100,000 CFUmL mixed growth of organisms with a predominant growth of an Escherichia coli. I am a bit lost where to go next as after six weeks of Cipro I still have the E.coli culture coming back as positive.",

        "instruction": "Hello doctor, After 21 months since my HIV diagnosis and have been undetectable for 15 of those months, two months back I was switched from the effective Truvada or Tivicay regimen to Triumeq. The sole explanation was that STR was more convenient. I am yet to do labs with Triumeq, but I have three concerns at this point 1. Was there any possibility of a viral rebound or a significant blip, 5 to 6 weeks into Triumeq use, due to a new combination of drugs.  I have 100  adherence and take medicines always at the same time, +- 2 hours 2. Due to some intensive driving trips, on a few days in the last two months while already on Triumeq, I had a can or two of energy drink shortly certainly less than two hours after taking my medicines and without realizing it contained some magnesium about 7 mg per can. Is this a significant enough amount to interfere with DTG absorption and thus efficacy.  The Triumeq guide instructs avoiding calcium or magnesium-containing antacids, but their quantities usually are much higher. In my case, this was less than in a medium size banana fruit. 3. While maintaining my UD status, how risky to my negative partner was the following episode during a sexual intercourse with me being in the receptive role.  He briefly inserted his penis rather deep into my rectum without condom and instantly had a tear at the top of the penis where it connects with foreskin. He pulled out right away, but his wound was already bleeding rather profusely. Was he at high risk of HIV infection, despite my UD status.",
        "output": "Hi. 1. It is not at all advised to substitute regimen with another drug on your own choice based on convenience. The reason is group resistance. The substitute you made are used in vice versa condition, that is used in case of failure to switch to second-line medication. 2. Dolutegravir has interaction with antacids which contain calcium and magnesium salts and these interfere with absorption, but nothing harm in occasional use, as drug remains above therapeutic levels for more than 5 to 7 days. 3. Anal activity has a significantly high risk, as there will be no active defense cells and there is increased chances of mucosal tears which increases chances of HIV transmission. So, he is at risk of transmission."

It was not more than 10 seconds before I found out, no ejaculation happened and I had no open sores on my penis or any other cuts, yet still I found a tiny amount of blood on the condom, I cannot think of any reason for the blood except that it could have been her menstrual blood just the beginning of it. I am of a good general health, smoker and have never been diagnosed with any STD or any serious disease. I have asked her if this was the first time for her to have a condom failure incident and she answered yes, she even had a general blood test for a full checkup and she was in good health as well as the HIV blood test two years ago. My questions are as follows1. I have read somewhere on the internet that the risk of transmission from a single encounter of unprotected vaginal sex is 0.065 , meaning that 99.935  do not get HIV, is that true. 2. Do you recommend I get tested for HIV.  I am thinking of getting a PCR test to check myself, how long should I wait before getting tested PCR and how accurate and reliable is that test. 3. Do you recommend that I go for the PCR test or should I go for the fourth generation test and how long should I wait as well before the result is conclusive. 4.

        "instruction": "Hi doctor, My fiance and I were fooling around yesterday and I had semen smeared all over my vagina. He was not wearing a condom. We did not have penetrative sex. However, after the encounter, I got nervous and got emergency pills. All this happened about 14 days after my last period. I assumed I was highly fertile and was at risk for pregnancy. P2, I took one about three hours after my vagina was smeared with semen. I took the next pill 12 hours after the first. Here are my questions 1. I really do not want a pregnancy right now. Is it wise if I take a second dose of the pill to completely reduce chances of implantation.  Is it safe to take a higher dose of pills to completely eradicate any possibility of pregnancy.  2. What else can I do to make sure I am completely out of the woods.  3. Also, after seven days, is it okay for me to start taking antibiotics to eradicate any infections passed.  Can general antibiotics like Amoxil treat the treatable STI.  4. When is the most prudent time to take an HIV test.  5. How effective is P2 when taken during ovulation.  I did a little research and some said that P2 will not help if it is taken during ovulation. 6. How can I in case I get pregnant make the uterus inhospitable for the growth of the embryo.  7. When should I take a pregnancy test.  8. What is the safest mode of getting rid of a fertilised egg within the first few weeks.  9. My period should be in two weeks or 15 days from now. Is it guarantee that if it delays I am pregnant.  Is it also possible for me to have my period yet still be pregnant.  10. Lastly, what are the chances in terms of percentage that I might be pregnant without necessarily having penetrative intercourse.",
        "output": "Hi. How are you doing.  That is a lot of questions, but all leading to the same answer. An emergency pill is high dose Progesterone, best taken within three days of sex. Best results if taken within 24 hours of sex. Being a high dose Progesterone, the uterine lining becomes very unfavorable for a possible embryo implantation. The lining suddenly becomes very thick. As it is a single dose, the lining cannot stand on its own and it falls off. But you rightly said success depends on which phase of the cycle you took it. If ovulation had just occurred that day, still there are equal chances of pregnancy and miscarriage. About the questions 1. You should have the second dose. It will improve chance of embryo not getting implanted. 2. Only after you reach the other end you can confirm that you are out of the woods. You will have to wait for the period. 3. You can have antibiotics anyday, Azithromycin, Doxycycline would be a better choice. 4. HIV can be tested any time now and after six months repeated. 5 and 6 already answered. 7. The pregnancy test can be done earliest one day after the expected period. 8. If positive, you will need a scan to confirm intrauterine pregnancy after two weeks, then MTP medical termination of pregnancy can be used. 9. Emergency pill disturbs the hormones, so only the pregnancy test will give you some information. 10. Sperms can swim up even from your thighs into the vagina, so the chance of pregnancy is still there."

Only concern is such cases is of HIV, and rarely of hepatitis B and hepatitis C, as other STDs sexually transmitted diseases are treatable and easily manageable, not life-threatening.

As you are already tested negative for HIV although early after the encounter, the chances are less. However, to reliably tell that one is negative, test at 12 weeks should be negative. So you should get your HIV combo test antibody plus P24 antigen, RNA test at 12 weeks after the encounter. Also, you should get anti HCV antibodies and HBsAg antigen test to rule out other viral infections.

Your HIV 1 and HIV 2 tests done on the nineteenth day is also negative. It indicates that you do not have any infection, but it is too early to say with certainty. So you need to repeat the fourth generation HIV test after 12 weeks of possible exposure.

My question I have read that after a certain window period time three months after getting negative is conclusive and even after six months confirmation is definitely negative. But, why are all these other people saying you can go years without showing positive and that is really freaking me out big time. Is it true that it takes years to come up positive or does it only take six months to know it 100 .  What is true.  Also, there is a doctor who says no test is 100  reliable. I am still 15 months post exposure. HIV RNA PCR qualitative all are negative. 20 months post exposure, HIV-Alere combo test result is negative. Any further test is needed.  I am negative now. Will my result change in the future.  What is 100  window period.  Please clarify my doubts. Thank you.",
        "output": "Hi. For this question, it is based on the test you do. HIV enters the body on day-0, and goes to the nearest lymph node and starts replication by day-7. This is when, p24 antigens core proteins of HIV virus get detected and in turn, the body starts defense and produces HIV antibodies, and these get tested positive in 15 to 23 days. But, due to neutralization of antigens by antibodies, as per theory, testing after 23 days up to 28 days may give false negatives <0.001. So, getting a fourth generation HIV test after 28 days is confirmation by 99 . Yes, not only in medical, but in any field, 100  is not possible. And taking medico legality, no one gives you 100  cure. No further test is needed. You are negative by 99.99 . A change in result is unlikely. You will stay negative forever. The window period is a period where lab tests cannot detect the presence of infection by tests. For more information consult an HIV AIDS specialist online ."

I went to the doctor, explained everything, took an HIV test and it came back negative. The node is hard and gets soft sometimes but has been there for months. Sometimes, I feel like there is pressure on my neck and ear, found another node recently on my neck, lower part of the left-hand side, soft and movable and another one on the front side of my ear on the left and I have a tooth that has been giving me problems for a while on the same side. Could this be HIV because I read that nodes on the neck are normally associated with it.",
        "output": "Hi. Lymphadenopathy is not related to HIV human immunodeficiency virus and probably caused by infected teeth as HIV infection takes approximately six months to one year to get lymphadenopathy. Get HIV test after 45 to 90 days with generation four dual tests or western blot to confirm infection. Soft movable node is probably due to infection and abscess may be formed. So, rule out TB tuberculosis. Finally, it is not HIV infection, for confirmation get tested after 45 days. For more information consult an HIV AIDS specialist online ."

I am so depressed and will go for testing after three months. Is my exposure high risk.  Which test should I do now.  And what are my chances for other STDs.",
        "output": "Hi. First, I need to inform you that, the oral cavity has the lowest viral load and the possibility of transmission is least to none. Secondly, the HIV virus has an envelope that is made of fats which will be digested by salivary enzymes. So, HIV survival is least in saliva. But, only indication to count is injury or ulcer in the oral cavity. Thirdly, coming to your scenario, oral sex cannot transmit the infection even if she had HIV infection considering she had no oral ulcers and you had no ulcer on the penis. You are not at risk of acquiring HIV. HIV has a window period of 45 days to three months. So get western blot test after 45 days to completely rule out HIV infection. Coming to STD, yes, you may get and chances are high. The infection can be HPV human papillomavirus, HSV herpes simplex virus. No need to have any measures at this stage.

        "output": "Hello. Firstly, your risk is unwarranted in this case. To the best of my knowledge, as per published literature, there is no case reported of HIV human immunodeficiency virus through kissing. Saliva itself has very low concentrations of HIV and also contains anti-HIV factors that prevent transmission. However, theoretically, there can be a risk if there is a presence of blood in the mouth of the other person like in the case if there is an active bleeding gums or sores or ulcers. It is good that your HIV test result at four weeks of exposure is negative. I suggest you get a confirmatory test at three months of last exposure.

I\ufe0f am an 18-year-old female and am overall very healthy and active. Six months ago, I was taken advantage of by a male in college whom I\ufe0f did not even know. This was my first sexual experience, and I\ufe0f have not had any since then, but I\ufe0f do not know his sexual background. He did not use a condom, but also did not have enough time to ejaculate inside of me because I\ufe0f got away. I\ufe0f had absolutely no symptoms until now. One month after the traumatic experience, I\ufe0f decided to get an IUD to protect me from any unwanted or unexpected situation. Three months after the sexual experience, I\ufe0f was admitted to the hospital due to gastrointestinal issues. After my release, I\ufe0f discovered that I\ufe0f tested positive for chlamydia. I\ufe0f took the two pills one dose that completely cleared my STI. In the hospital, would they have been able to tell from my blood work if I\ufe0f was HIV positive or not.  Now three months later, six months after the initial experience weird symptoms have begun to show. I\ufe0f first had a sore throat, and then only one of my lymph nodes on my left side of my neck slightly started to swell, but not significantly enough to show through the skin. At first, the lymph node was hard, but now i\u200et is starting to soften. After, I\ufe0f started having nosebleeds. Then, large red bumps started to appear in the back of my tongue, and some on the side of my tongue, but none of them are painful. I\ufe0f have no bumps in my throat or roof of the mouth or underneath the tongue, just on the back. I\ufe0f have never noticed these bumps before. Around the bumps, there was also some white coating, which was easy to brush off, but when I\ufe0f did there was still no bleeding. I\ufe0f have no rash, no night sweats, no fever or anything. But from research, i\u200et says that these kind of bumps are common for HIV positive people, as well as swollen lymph nodes. I\ufe0f also have found small white specks in my stool, but no other parts of my body have been affected but my mouth and throat. The back of my throat is still sore and scratchy, but I\ufe0f have no vocal changes. If not HIV, could I\u200et be some other STD or viral infection that is serious.  Could i\u200et be another problem with my gastrointestinal tract.  And what can I\ufe0f do to get rid of these bumps.  It has been less than a week with these symptoms.

The relationship included oral sex and vaginal sex. The relationship was completely protected also oral and I put on a condom I do not know if it got broken. After two days of the incident, I noticed a small red bloodbath on my scrotum, which later grew the skin doctor diagnosed it as an angerectomy. After about two weeks after the incident, I began to have severe pain in the legs and feet that have gone and are still coming today randomly. In addition, 10 days after the incident, my temperature rose to 37.5 for about a month and a half. After a month or so, I started to get a lot of wounds in my chest, shoulders, and back the dermatologist diagnosed it as a folliculitis. These wounds are coming and going today. In addition, many small red dots about 50 to 60 have begun to appear on the skin especially in the chest and arms to this day, more and more news appears the skin doctor claimed to be hemangiomas. It looks like a little blood blister. Also, I suffer from severe dehydration in the skin and palms for a long period of three months, there is really a white layer of dryness and even hand cream does not help. Lately, I have also realized that my tongue always feels dry and the color is white with a little white bump in the end. I have lost weight about 5 kg for a period of two months. In addition, strong head pain that comes and goes and a painkiller does not help at all, and also suffers from fatigue all the time. I have done a lot of testing of HIV combo Ag-Ab, fourth generation, and all were negative. In addition, two weeks ago four and a half months of the case, I tested hepatitis B and C negative result. As well as an antibody test for syphilis SCR by ELISA negative result. In addition to the above, about a week after the incident, I began to feel a stab at the end of the penis, and I also had a feeling of burning at the end of urination.

Does the test detect all sub-types and all strains of the virus.  Can it be that I have HIV 2 and the test cannot detect antibodies because it can take a longer time.  I read that sometimes in rare cases it can take a year to detect enough antibodies and before that all the test will be a false negative, is that really possible.  Is there anything new that has emerged in the medical literature at this time that figured out from what all I have said.",

There is no need to do another type of test.

The condom did not break nor leak but maybe was not put perfectly. I did not manage to cum, removed it and masturbated in a very aggressive way with my bare hands for some minutes. She spit twice on my dick, that is all. Since then, I had major symptoms starting from day-2 with burning sensation and painful urination for some days and my genital organ was tender and painful. I took Ceftriaxone and a short course of Ciproxen on my own assuming I had gonorrheachlamydia without any test. On day-5 started a very weird tingling numbness in all the limbs which continued for a week or a bit more, sores in mouth on and off starting from the first week including a huge one in the roof of my mouth, headache, low appetite, weakness, and myalgia. Later on, I started to realize changes in the nails after one month, joints pain still ongoing, no fever nor lymphadenopathy, most importantly I lost a lot of pounds and lost appetite and lost weight especially in my face - around the eyes and mouth. I want to mention that I never stopped crying from the very first day of being horrified of HIV. I got psychological and psychiatric consultation several times with no help.

        "output": "Hello. I have noted your concern. Protected sex is safe as far as the risk of HIV is concerned. Spitting on bare penis is not a risk for HIV as saliva is not infectious. The virus cannot survive in saliva because it contains enzymes inhibitory for the virus. Moreover, a fourth generation antigenantibody HIV screening test is considered conclusive at six weeks and beyond by most sexual specialists. Therefore I do not think you need to worry about HIV. However, you may take an RNA PCR test for HIV in order to reassure yourself."

Duroxime for weight loss can increase blood pressure which will be counteracted by Idaprex for high blood pressure. There is no drug interaction between Citalopram for depression and Idaprex. Citalopram has a serious drug interaction with Duromine. Citalopram may increase the effects of Phentermine, and side effects such as nervousness and anxiety. A rare but serious condition called the serotonin syndrome can occur that includes symptoms such as hallucination, seizure, extreme changes in blood pressure, increased heart rate, excessive sweating, shivering or shaking, blurred vision, muscle spasm or stiffness, and tremor. You should regularly consult with your doctor and do report if any of these symptoms occur. You have been prescribed Prednisolone Panafcortelone. This might be for the renal failure. But Prednisolone is known to cause depression, weight gain, and high blood pressure itself. You must get clarified with the consulting doctor about the prescription of Prednisolone why it has been prescribed.

When I told my mother about it, she confessed that she had known since I was 16 and that my father died of AIDS whilst she has been on ART for almost a decade now. They realized my status after I got tested since I was having frequent abscess wounds or boils, almost on a monthly basis but they never told me about it. I am a health student and interact with a lot of health professionals hence my hesitation to seek help to start treatment just in case I meet up with someone I know. However, my major concern is that I have recently been having drowsiness spells and frequent, almost consistent headaches though they are very light. An FBC test done a month ago showed that my Hb and HCT, as well as my neutrophil count, were slightly below normal, and I was advised to go on a month of Saferon tablets which I followed religiously. Recent full blood tests showed that my RBC, Hb, HCT, MCV, and MCH values were all now slightly below normal whilst all my WBC were within the normal range. The Hb and HCT went lower than the initial test. Therefore, my questions are, might this be related to my HIV positive status and how so.  Also if it is, why is it that my white blood cells are not affected.  I am mostly curious about whether such an instance as mine is quite common where a patient is born with HIV and lives an otherwise normal livelihood though with more frequent infections that go away after some time.

I had a fever and severe shivering. I took Doxicycllin three tablets in one dose, but I did not get better. Then, I started vomiting up too. So, I was taken to the hospital and prescribed oral medicines since I hesitated to get admitted because I was to write my CA exams in two days. So, I took the oral medicines. They were Orni-O, Pan DSR, and Bifilac. But I did not get alright still as I could not take any food inside and I vomited blue foamy. So, I was admitted and put on IV fluids and antibiotics.

        "output": "Hi. Please do not think of such rare conditions for small symptoms. May I give you a few information about cancer of the vagina. Basically cancer or dysplasia has a genetic background. In the case of a few cancers like cervical and vaginal cancers, it is due to HPV infections human papilloma virus. Also, in oral or lung where smoking is a cause due to repeated injury by the tar. A common thing to note is, be it infection or tar it causes repeated damage to the healthy tissue. This injury heals before it heals the next injury come and so it goes on till the healing is replaced by cells which are abnormal, which takes many years. Once these abnormal cells come on, they keep dividing into abnormal cells. After many years, these cells dominate to form cancer. Now in female genital cancer, the commonest is uterine, next ovarian, next cervical, then fallopian tubes and the rarest is vaginal. Since it is due to HPV infection, it is seen in those with sex exposure at a young age with compounding sexually transmitted diseases, HIV, multiple sex partners or repeated injury to the vagina. The best part is it has no symptoms. The cases will present with a lot of foul smelling brownish or bloody discharge usually around 50s to 60s as cancer cells take so many years to reach such a stage to be detected. From your history, I do not see even a single risk factor other than that you have a vagina. For further information consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online ."

HPV is found in 7 of all oral cavities in your country with only 1 HPV 16. There is no clear evidence how people get the virus in their oral cavities some people never practiced oral sex. Also, the HPV is a weak virus. People with adequate immunity can overcome it easily. On the contrary, HPV 16 is the main cause of cervical cancer in females, and that is why they should be screened and get vaccinated for it. It is similar to HIV. There is no evidence that people get HPV infected with kissing. You should not be worried as it is very rare to get laryngeal cancer because of oral sex.

Now, in the scenario you are explaining, it is less likely for any virus or infectious disease to transmit to other, but small risk of transmission remains. There are two reasons. Considering you are applying makeup on intact skin, so in that case, it is unlikely for any infection to transmit. Secondly, if you are applying it on the skin where you have given injections, then a small possible risk is there, but risk is further reduced by the deactivation of viruses by colors. So overall, there is a minute risk may be less than 0.1 percent, which is really small. So, I think you should stop worrying about it and use a separate container from next time.

I suggest applying Triamcinolone ointment over it twice daily and observe if it goes down. Eat a healthy diet rich in folic acid and all other vitamins. Take plenty of green leafy vegetables and fruits and have an active lifestyle. Meanwhile, it is advisable to get your boyfriend tested for HIV. If there are multiple partners involved then it is better both of you get tested regularly. It is always safer to use protection while having an anal intercourse. The receptive partner has more chances of getting the virus from the dominant one during an anal intercourse as the anorectal mucosa is very soft and can easily tear.

Being my first male to male exposure, I was not very sure to engage in anal sex and I just tried inserting and I am sure even I was not too hard enough to penetrate when I tried to. So, I removed the condom and just ejaculated. Before that, I had unprotected oral sex. Once I was about to leave the place, I found a tinge of blood on the top of the used condom. It happened over three months ago. I tested the partner on the same day for HIV fourth generation AbAg test and he tested negative. From then, I am panicked about being contracted with HCV and HIV. In the due course, I got a small sore on my penis which was examined by a dermatologist and he was very sure that it was not a syphilis sore I explained all that happened. Eight weeks later, I wanted the person who had all other STD tests including syphilis, HCV, and HIV. He tested positive for syphilis and only now he is on treatment. My VDRL and TPHA results are negative until the last test 90 days after the exposure. Further, I underwent Anti-HIV Combo abag, Anti HCV, VDRL, TPHA, HIV RNA PCR qualitative several times in the last three months and got the results as non-reactive and non-detected. Now it has been 13 weeks and three days since the possible exposure. All the above tests were taken in a reputed lab. Apart from the above, HIV RNA qualitative and Western blot tests were also done in a different lab twice eight and 10 weeks post exposure and were negative. My fear is If there was any exposure by touching the blood while I pulled off my condom and that had contact with my penile gland when I ejaculated though I did not have any open cut or sore, did not see any bleeding or blood tinge on my penis when I washed my penis after the mishap, will I be at a greater risk of contracting HIV or HCV though the partner was tested negative for HIV and HCV two months post this mishap.  With the above tests done now after three months, what is the chance that I had contracted HIV or HCV.  With articles on the internet talking about HIV and HCV co-infection which delays HIV seroconversion, make me go mad. With the tests done can I allay my fears of HIV at least.  As my partner is positive for syphilis, is my three months negative VDRL conclusive on me.  Is there any other test I can do to put my mind at peace.  It has been three months since I slept and now I feel that my liver is bulged and my ribs are aching. I know I am paranoid but an assurance from you as a doctor would give me more confidence. Please help.",
        "output": "Hello. Since the blood was on the outside of the condom, therefore, it was almost certainly not in direct contact with your penis. Your screening tests are negative on multiple occasions and they are conclusive. A negative Combo test Anti HIV antibody test and P24Ag test is considered conclusive at six weeks by most HIV human immunodeficiency virus specialists. Similarly, anti-HCV hepatitis C and HBsAg hepatitis B are reliable six weeks onwards in those with possible exposure. VDRL venereal disease research laboratory usually becomes positive three weeks after infection but because of the variable incubation period of syphilis of nine to 90 days, it is certainly conclusive if it is negative at three months. So a negative at three months in your case is conclusive."

        "output": "Hello. I have gone through your wife is TORCH toxoplasmosis, rubella, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex, and HIV test reports. There are two types of antibodies that were investigated, IgG and IgM to exclude infection. The result could be positive or negative, it depends on the finding of IgG and IgM. A positive test result means IgG and IgM antibodies are found in one or more infections covered in screening. IgM antibodies represent that there is a current or recent infection. You can have repeat testing to confirm it again from another authentic lab. The presence of IgG indicates a past infection or vaccinated previously. Reinvestigation after two weeks of the test is better to confirm it and again to compare antibodies as well. In the meantime, inform your results to the treating consultant immediately. If the newborn tests positive for IgM antibodies, current infection is the most likely cause. If both IgG and IgM are found in the newborn, it is probably antibodies from the mother transferred to the baby. In short, she is having an infection, and that can harm the baby as well. Baby can have multiple congenital anomalies like congenital rubella and CMV cytomegalovirus syndrome, sensorineural defects, blindness, hearing loss, premature delivery, growth restriction, neonatal herpes, microcephaly, intracranial calcification, rash, conjunctivitis, thrombocytopenia, hepatosplenomegaly, etc. A detailed anomaly scan is needed urgently. If the mother gets an infection in the early trimester, diagnosed as well with active infection few consultants give an option of termination as well after describing risks of having congenital anomalies due to active infection. Immediately inform to treating consultant about the positive report, have a detailed fetal anomaly scan and discuss with your obstetrician regarding the fetal outcome.

Firstly, the virus does not survive outside the body for more than a few seconds and dies quickly in drying. Secondly, intact skin does not provide access to the bloodstream. However, even if we assume that you had a break in your skin barrier at that time, then also a paper thin cut or a scratch that is not even bleeding does not provide access to the bloodstream.

The fourth generation combo test came negative and RT-PCR viral load came below the detectable limit. Can my test be conclusive.  Am I risk-free from HIV.",
        "output": "Hi. Protected sex is safe as far as risk of HIV is concerned. Insertive or sex has a negligible risk of transmission of HIV. As far as testing is concerned, only a four-week fourth generation HIV screening test is considered reliable. Though even that has to be followed up by a 12-week screening test for a conclusive result. RNA PCR polymerase chain reaction is a very sensitive test early on after possible infection. A negative test at 23 days is fairly conclusive. A fourth-generation HIV screening test has a window period ranging from 18 to 45 days. Whereas RNA PCR has a short window period of 9 to 13 days. Therefore both the tests taken together reliably excludes the risk of HIV. For more information consult an HIV AIDS specialist online ."

As you have given a history that you experience smelly white vaginal discharge without redness burning or itching since more than a year, and you had treatment for trichomonas, I would suggest you have a high and low vaginal swab to confirm the diagnosis. But as per history, it seems like an imbalance between normal and abnormal bacteria of the vagina. This might be due to It increases the risk of getting other STDs like chlamydia, gonorrhea, or PID pelvic inflammatory disease. It even increases the chances of getting HIV if having contact with an infected person. If pregnant, there are more chances of preterm laborpremature delivery. At present, you are not having symptoms, but you might have pain, itching and burning in the vagina, burning during urination, itching outside the vagina and strong fish-like odor after having sex as well.

Started with constant sneezing followed by a runny nose, then nose cleared and sneezing stopped but felt an uneasiness in palate and throat turned sore, getting worse with time and then persistent coughing. I consulted my general practitioner on the fourth or fifth day who prescribed some medications. I started feeling better after the seventh day and the throat improved. But almost the next day onwards I started feeling worse again but this time it was not sore throat or a runny nose exactly, just felt the mucous inside throat all the time. Never felt feverish as such or found raised body temperature by touching only and experienced mild body ache here and there. Nevertheless, around 1 month after this resolved totally as said above, since yesterday I have started feeling same common cold symptoms, runny nose not sneezing or coughing much though with uneasiness in the palate, no raised body temperature but little feverish with mild body ache here and there.In both the aforesaid cases I had taken a Cetirizine tablet on the same day but little later in the day the symptoms started.

So, I would advise you to get yourself checked. It will help in relieving your anxiety and fear. Unresponsiveness to Cetirizine is likely due to development of tolerance which means some medicine becomes less efficacious if taken repeatedly, which recovers within few months of a drug-free interval. It is not at all related to HIV. You appear to have another viral infection now and I would suggest Tablet Paracetamol 500 mg whenever needed for your body aches, uneasiness and fever if develops. Also, instead of Cetirizine, you can have Tablet Allegra Fexofenadine hydrochloride 60 mg twice a day up to two to three days. Its similar to Cetirizine. If you do not respond in 3-4 days then you will need antibiotics as well. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and take the medicines with their consent.

        "output": "Hello. I have noted your concern and I have viewed the attachments attachment removed to protect patient identity. Receiving unprotected oral sex though much less of a risk as compared to unprotected vaginal or anal sex, is still not entirely safe. There is a possibility of acquiring herpes simplex infection, gonorrhea and chlamydia through oral sex though HIV has a negligible risk unless the person performing oral sex has oral sores or bleeding gums. As far as testing is concerned HIV has been convincingly ruled out in you at six weeks. Even CDC says a negative HIV combo test antibody and P24 antigen test is conclusive at six weeks. Though your HSV, IgG, and IgM are negative at six weeks a 12 to 16-week negative HSV, IgG would be more reliable as IgG may sometimes appear later. A negative IgM is not very reliable in ruling out HSV as it is short lasting even though it appears quite early. Chlamydia has been adequately ruled out. Gonorrhea is mostly symptomatic in males. So, if you still do not have any symptoms of gonococcal urethritis like pus discharge from the urethra and burning on micturition, it suggests that you do not have gonorrhea. So to summarize, you just need to repeat HSV IgG at 12 to 16 weeks. Rest all the STDs have been ruled out. HCV hepatitis C and HBV hepatitis B is not a risk through oral sex."

I am not sure if it was a third or fourth generation test. I tested negative with a fourth generation test four months back because I thought I might be having some symptoms. And I remembered the flu-like illness about six months after exposure. I weighed 204 kg three months back and now I weigh 191 kg. I have worried a lot pacing the floor, sleep loss for past five months, took Paxil, and realized my worry could account for some weight loss. Shortly, after the test, I had the following symptoms I started having a small patch of 8 to 10 pinpoint sized pink-light red dots under the skin of my left wrist that have been there for two to three weeks. I also had a smooth, flat spot about 38 inch in diameter that appeared on the back of my right hand about a week ago, that has now faded to a pinkish brown. I have read about Kaposi sarcoma being a definer of AIDS, but do not understand how that could happen with a non-reactive fourth generation test four months back. Three months back, I had sinus type headaches multiple times that would sometimes be severe. After three rounds of antibiotics and a CT scan two months back that showed shadowing in a sinus, my ENT doctor just told me this week that there is something in my sphenoid sinus. He is treating it with a rinse for inflammation for three weeks before I see him again. I have had blood in my mucous from my nose for past three months. It dries out in my nose and causes blood almost every time I pick at it. The ENT doctor said that the lining of my nose had been worn down from this, but did not seem concerned about it. I do mess with it a lot, and blow my nose a lot. My PSA elevated quickly in the last six months, going from 1.2 to 3.5. A biopsy two months back showed an early cancer in one of the 12 regions biopsied. I had a lithotripsy on an 8 mm kidney stone this month and I am still passing dark urine. I was told that I do have several small stones still in each kidney. I have had multiple stones over the years. I have a swelling sensation all the way around my waist down into my groin at times that has been there for about two months, but no noticeable swelling. Several doctors have felt in my abdomen and detected nothing abnormal. A CT scan with no contrast 10 days ago showed no abnormalities other than a little swelling in the right kidney where the 8 mm stone was blocking the passage into the ureter. A CT with contrast five months back was normal except for showing stones. But I have microscopic blood in my urine since then. My vital signs have consistently been normal for past five months, including temperature, BP and oxygen. I know I am getting old and some of these symptoms happen with age. But it is driving me crazy that so much has happened since my negative fourth generation test which is supposed to detect antibodies may not be conclusive after three to four years of exposure. I had Zoloft 100 mg daily earlier but currently, on Paxil 40 mg and Propranolol 60 mg daily. After nearly four years of exposure and a negative antibody test four months back, would that test have detected antibodies if I were in a stage of HIV or AIDS.  Do you think it was conclusive.  Or is there another test I should have done.  I have read about an HIV RNA test, but it says early detection. I understand that it detects more than the antibodies. What are your thoughts on my next step.",
        "output": "Hi. Your test done before four months is certainly conclusive and final. A three months intervening periodwindow period between risk exposure and a fourth generation HIV screening test is good enough for it to be considered conclusive. 95  of those infected with HIV will have detectable antibodies by four weeks and by 12 weeks, or three months 100  of HIV infected individual will have detectable antibodies. Antibodies once formed will remain detectable by screening tests. In fact, antibody based HIV screening tests are the gold standard tests for the diagnosis of infection whereas an HIV RNA PCR test is more commonly utilized as a measure of response to antiretroviral therapy in HIV AIDS patients rather than as a diagnostic or screening test.

Tethering of sigmoid colon with distal ileal loops to the uterus in fundus region.",
        "output": "Hello. With this report, there is a possibility of malignancy. Cancer of the uterus is more likely. Do CA 125 level, CT scan abdomen and pelvis, X-ray, sonography, PET scan and consult a gynecologist near you and also take an opinion from an oncosurgeon. Doctors will do other routine investigations also like LFT, RFT, hemogram, HIV, Au-Ag, blood group, 2D echo, ECG. All this is to be done and consultation along with clinical examination required for deciding further management of this if to directly go for surgery or not. In that case, the best option is chemotherapy or radiotherapy. But yes, you need to take steps on an urgent basis if the MRI report is like this and you suspect malignancy with some changes. I do not want to over exaggerate this but malignancy can grow way faster than you imagine. The final diagnosis will be after sending for biopsy or HPE histopathological examination. I do not know why you have done the MRI and what complaints she has, but whatever it is, if this is what the report says, then the above things should be done as soon as possible.

Antibodies against HIV are not a very effective defense against this virus and though they may initially contribute in keeping the virus under check they eventually fail to do so.

But, the entire condom does not cover my penis, which worried me if some tiny secretion could have entered into the condom. There are no cuts or sores around my penis area.

        "output": "Hello. I have noted your concern. There is no risk of HIV due to a cut from a used blade even if it was earlier used on an HIV positive person and had his infected blood on it. This is because the HIV virus is very fragile and cannot survive outside the body for more than a few seconds. It dies quickly on drying. Moreover, your screening test for HIV CMIA combo result at 55 days is conclusive. This test has a short window period of two to three weeks and it is considered conclusive at six weeks 45 days as recommended by CDC. Consuming neem leaves does not interfere with the test result."

Unprotected receptive sex from an HIV positive female insertive fellatio carries a very low risk of passing the virus and perhaps it is impossible to get HIV that way unless of course, she had oral sores or bleeding gums. The symptoms that you have are non-specific and may be experienced by someone with the seasonal flu. Since it has already been six weeks since the event, you may get screened by a 4th generation HIV antigenantibody screening test which would be conclusive.

As I said before the girl is just fine, no noticeable health issues. Do you still think it is possible for me to get HIV from her.  What step should I take now.",

Unprotected oral sex is still less of a risk as compared to unprotected vaginal or anal sex but the risk is not zero with oral sex. Protected vaginal sex is safe and a skin cut on the finger that is not freshly bleeding is not a risk. A cut that is a few hours old is self-sealing. As far as your symptoms are concerned they are non-specific and partly due to anxiety.

Kissing on the skin is also not a risk. HIV is only transmitted through unprotected sex - either vaginal, anal or oral sex. Still, if you want to get tested you may take an antigen antibody screening test at four weeks for a conclusive result. At nine days it is possible to take an HIV RNA PCR test as it has a short window period of nine to 13 days."

It will be very cumbersome initially but over time you will learn to avoid the offending stuff. Although regarded less predictive than skin prick test, blood allergy testing may be useful in you in reducing the positive allergen detection.

Moreover, you have tested yourself for HIV human immunodeficiency virus, syphilis, and herpes. All are negative. The only thing which can remain silent and lead to a problem is syphilis.

When I was consuming this, I got heavy pain in my body and after some days I found that fat under my thighs, palms, hands, legs, chest, feet and soles has been lost it is still continuing. A swollen lymph node in neck appeared and my left parotid gland became swollen. I consulted an ENT. He prescribed Moxclav 625. The swelling in the parotid gland subsided and again after some days there was swelling and the doctor gave me Piroxicam. Again it subsided and then after some days again the same problem raised and the doctor gave me Claribid 500 for five days and it subsided. A scan was done on my neck and the result showed Enlarged left parotid gland with diffuse decrease in echogenicity possibly parotitis.

Was there any ulcer over the scrotum during the swelling.  The symptoms which you have are very non-specific and can be associated with any chronic illness. So further tests will be guided by your symptoms. Are you in touch with the lady, if yes does she have any particular illness.  Firstly, there is very less likelihood of HIV, almost nil. At this stage, the possibilities I would keep are of syphilis. However, your VDRL is negative. Orit may just be a psychological issue due to overthinking about that exposure. Anyway, you will need some more investigations like complete hemogram with ESR and CRP, liver and renal function test, ANA antibody test, chest X-ray. For syphilis, you will need other tests like FTA-ABS or TPPA or MHA TP. If none of the above are informative, we may need a CT scan of the neck, chest, and abdomen.

HIV is spread mainly by having an unprotected anal or vaginal sex with someone who has HIV, sharing needles or syringes of an infected person, or from mother to child during pregnancy, birth, or breastfeeding. Transmission from homosexual males is more than transmission from a female to male. HIV can also be affected by receiving blood transfusions and blood products. About your query, every infection does not need to be related to HIV and having unnecessary anxiety as does your general physician states. Without knowing the health status of your partner, we cannot judge the acquaintance of HIV virus. If you are in doubt, you can go for HIV investigation to confirm this. Without any proper evidence of active infection, there will not be any point in making this diagnosis."

Negativity of this tests also goes in favor that you have not acquired HIV infection.

To be absolutely sure, you can go for virus culture which is undertaken only in specialized laboratories or polymerase chain reaction PCR test. But, it is quite expensive. ARS Acute retroviral syndrome symptoms usually start after 2-4 weeks of initial exposure and your rashes and sore tongue might be due to some other reason.

She has to be under the supervision of her gynecologist. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicine with their consent. I wish her a quick recovery.

Two years ago, she had a mild allergic reaction after eating raw apples which we were told was oral allergy syndrome. She has recently had mild reactions to cherries, oranges and snap peas. A few days ago, she had an allergic reaction at school that she believes was from applesauce. She developed hives on her face. We have an appointment with an allergist next month, but I am wondering what I can do to minimize the risk while we are waiting for an appointment. She is avoiding apples and other foods that she thinks she reacted to. Since she seems to have developed new reactions to other foods, I cannot really know what those would be in advance. Would dosing with an antihistamine daily be appropriate and helpful.",

No infection of HIV - clinically tested every 6 months since last 7 years. I am straight and only 1 relationship with spouse. Both me and my spouse are not having HIV - clinically tested. I had bacterialfungal infection with pus and redness in the genital area and so blood test was done. I recently got tested and the report is as follows HIV -ve. HSV-1 IgG 4.5 +ve. HSV-1 IgM 0.29 -ve. HSV-2 IgG 0.45 -ve. HSV-2 IgM 0.69 -ve. HSV-1 is mostly a non-genital infection. I have not had any episode of HSV-1 type herpes in my life. I have never had HSV-1 type herpes anywhere in the body. How can blood show HSV-1 IgG positive without any symptoms.  Doctor dermatologist says it is because of past infection and there is no present infection. Doctor told that I should take antiviral dose Acyclovir for 20days for HSV-1 IgG past infection. Is it useful to take antiviral dose for past HSV-1 type infection.  Will it reduce the IgG level in blood.  Is HSV-1 IgG showing a false positive result.  Question 1  Should I take Acyclovir medicine for HSV-1 IgG positive results.  Blood test done on 20th January 2015 Question 2  Should I retest for HSV-1.  Question 3  Is HSV-1 transmitted via intercourse or sexual contacts.  Question 4 Is HSV-1 a life threatening disease.  Question 5  Does HSV-1 positive at present means that I had infected with HSV-1 3 or 4 months back but no symptoms at present.  Question 6  Various herbs like monolaurin, a coconut ingredient are proven to flush outkill HSV-1 virus from nerves, how far is this trustworthy.  Please explain.",
        "output": "Hi. Thank you for providing all the details. I shall answer your questions one by one. 1. As you have mentioned that you do not have any symptoms at the moment, there is no need to take Acyclovir. 2. A repeat test can be done just for your reassurance. Chances of false positive result is there with every test due to technical errors. 3. HSV-1 is primarily not transmitted through sexual intercourse, but kissing or oral sex can cause transmission to partners. 4. Except encephalitis, HSV-1 causes no life threatening diseases. 5. A positive IgG means exposure to the virus anytime during your entire life. IgM shows present infection. You might have had a sub-clinical infection earlier, which is very common. 6. The herbs do not work and there is no data to support this. Hope this relieves your anxiety. Take care. Revert back to a dermatologist online for further follow up ."

        "instruction": "Hello doctor, I am sorry as this will be a bit long. I will try to explain concisely. I am a 40 year old male, and I weigh 100 kg and 1.85 m tall. I have toxoplasmosis. Last year, I had a weird throat ache, like a persistent itch on the upper side of my left palatine tonsil. It is hard to describe, but it felt like having a stray bit of food stuck there. Over the course of a few weeks, it grew more and more painful, with pain radiating into the left ear and swollen lymph nodes on left side of my neck. So, I went to my doctor. He noticed an irritation there, and said it could be gastric reflux, and prescribed Esomeprazole, which had no effect. We tried some antibiotics, again without result. Other symptoms were mild fever and fatigue. So, after a month, I went to see an ENT specialist. This is when the fun starts. He examined my throat with an endoscope, saw nothing, and said it was gastric reflux. I told him I was a smoker, and he replied that for my peace of mind, we could take some time to figure it out and scheduled an endoscopic lung examination. A procedure which requires general anesthesia, to probe a bit that does not hurt and without doing any kind of non-invasive exam like an x-ray first. I did not do it. However, I did the other exams he wanted like radiography of left sinus and echography of sub-mandibulary gland, both the tests found nothing. The symptoms receded without treatment in the same way they had come, and by two months, everything was gone. And by the end of last year, that itch in my throat came back just like before, and then it became very painful again, with the same scenario. The symptoms were swollen lymph nodes on left side of the neck, mild fever 38C, and fatigue. I also got muscle aches in various places, mostly left arm and left side of the chest muscles. So during the start of this year, I went back to see that specialist. He looked at my throat again, and he found nothing. So, he told me maybe it is psychosomatic, but I should still do an MRI just in case. I went back to my doctor and started from scratch. We did a throat swab, which was normal. The blood test showed toxoplasmosis IgG 2.8 IUmL and toxoplasmosis IgM 3.25 IUmL. Everything else was normal, and I do not have HIV, Lyme, hepatitis A, B, or C, and thyroid hormones are normal. So, I have toxoplasmosis, which according to my doctor, explains all the symptoms except the throat ache, which is very worrying. He says I should still do the MRI. I went to see another ENT who said toxoplasmosis also explains the throat ache, and I should not worry. He told me not to do the MRI. He also told me I had reflux, so I stopped worrying. Does toxoplasmosis and acid reflux explain all the symptoms.  Should I do that MRI.  Or perhaps do other tests.  I smoked from age 25 until last year. I quit for six months, then smoked again for six months, and now just quit again, hopefully for good. Also, I used to drink alcohol in unreasonable quantities at night with friends, but I stopped that too. Since then, I have learned that cigarette and alcohol are a risk of amygdala cancer, but I probably have not got that. Still, it is a good reason to get rid of unhealthy habits. I gained 20 pounds last year after quitting smoking. And lost them with a bit of cycling and a little diet. Right now, I am in a general good shape except a bit of a stomach. When I used to cycle a lot, my rest heart rate was 55 bpm. I had too much work recently to exercise properly, so I am around 70 to 75 bpm right now, and my blood pressure is normal.

But, unfortunately, it did not work for me. Four months ago, I had what I believed was ARS with chills, rashes, nausea, and peripheral neuropathy. I then took an HIV fourth generation test which came out negative. However, my symptoms got worse. The sores in my anus did not heal up, and I suddenly developed psoriasis with psoriatic arthritis. I had pain in my joints including fingers, knees, and elbows. My finger nails have also been affected. There was a change in the color of fingernails, and my nails had thickened. More recently, I took a comprehensive STD panel test. It tested for syphilis, chlamydia, gonorrhea, HIV, Hepatitis B and C, and Herpes 1 and 2. The only positive one was HSV 1 and 2. Now, I am so worried. I strongly feel that I am infected with HIV, but the fourth generation tests are not picking up the p24 antigen or antibodies for a reason. My last sexual exposure was seven months ago. What other tests can I do to rule out an HIV infection.  Since psoriatic arthritis is an immune disorder, could it delay the production of antibodies, hence giving a false negative HIV result.  Has my body not produced enough antibodies yet for the test to pick up an HIV infection.  How long does the p24 antigen stay detectable in the body following exposure to HIV infection.  What are the reasons behind a false negative HIV result.  I tested past the three month window period. I tested at five months and seven months post-exposure. Could I have an immunodeficiency that has not been diagnosed and is not making antibodies show up.  If antibodies have not been produced by now, will not the p24 antigen still be in the body.  How long does the p24 antigen stay in the body.  Is there ever a time of HIV infection where both the p24 antigen and antibodies will be missing or too low for the fourth generation tests to pick up.  I have read articles online that says there are a few people who do not produce antibodies to HIV at all and they will always have a negative antibody test. How true is that.  Please help me.",

I have a small penis, 3.5 to maximum 4 inches when erect, and we had intercourse in a single position as I said above. Can it be implied that the risk was very low in such a case.  I understand the foreskin retracts during the act exposing its inner surface. Given the size of my penis, did the condom had a higher chance to slide upwards to a vulnerable level.  So far I recall, there was no fitting issue. Through which area in the penis does HIV enter.  Some say it enters through the glans, some through the opening at the tip, some say through the gap between glans and foreskin, and some say through the foreskin itself. Kindly clarify. Is it easy for HIV to cause infection once it enters through any of the above or does the body is system resist and kill the virus at times.  I have read the chance of one catching HIV is 1 in 263. What does this effectively imply.  I know the only way to determine HIV is by doing a test. However, right now I definitely cannot have any such test done due to certain reasons. In the absence of the test, if you could reply with clear and specific answers to the above queries, it will help calm me to a great extent. Thank you so much for your patience and time.",

I just read your query and saw the attachment provided by you attachment removed to protect patient identity, and it appears that you have urticaria or hives in simpler terms. These usually occur when your immune system is a bit low such as during your periods, after a recent illness, due to some medication, recent travel, foods, perfumes, hair dyes, detergents, lotions, creams, clothes, exposure to new pets, dust, mold, chemicals, plants, etc. It can also occur after contact with nickel, rubber, latex, industrial chemicals, nail polish, hot or cold exposure, exercise, and alcohol ingestion. I would suggest that you do some blood tests to know what is going on. In the meantime, the best treatment is to avoid exposure to any of the causative agents. I suggest the use of some antihistamines such as tablet Loratadine 10 mg and topical Hydrocortisone 1  cream, once daily for 3 to 5 days, whenever you get these rashes. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. Do go to the nearest ER, if your rashes worsen and you have breathing difficulty.

These are usually hormone related and frequently regress after menopause. It is always recommended to increase vegetables and fruit intake, and exercise regularly. Get regular breast examination to make sure that the size is not increasing. Also, fibroadenomas are affected by hormones and tend to fluctuate in size during menstrual cycle or if using oral contraceptives, and these may even shrink after menopause. Local reoccurrence of fibroadenoma is common. Sexually transmitted diseases STD are due to organisms that hide in vaginal secretions, semen, blood, and sometimes saliva. Many of these are spread through contact with infected body fluids or semen. Having unprotected without condom vaginal, anal, or oral sex with someone who has STD is the usual mode through which it can be acquired. It is difficult to tell if someone has STD, as there can be no symptoms or signs. Genital touching can also transmit some of these diseases like syphilis or herpes.

        "output": "Hi. The quality of your pictures was unfortunately not very good, but decent enough to allow me to make a provisional diagnosis attachment removed to protect patient identity. It seems that you are suffering from a form of contact allergic eczema. It is an eczema in response to an allergy to some agricultural substance or vegetation product or chemical such as a pesticide or fertilizer or some other occupational exposure substance. It is also possible that you may have an intrinsic tendency of allergies in general and reacting to these purported substances, in an out of proportion way due to that tendency. I suggest applying a potent corticosteroid cream, preferably with an antifungal combination, such as Tenovate-M Clobetasol propionate cream or a plain potent steroid cream or ointment such as Halox or Halovate Halobetasol propionate ointment to be applied twice a day over the affected areas for a duration of 15 days. Additionally, I suggest tablet Allegra Fexofenadine 180 mg one tablet to be taken daily in the evening around 6 to 7 PM for 10 days. Try to visit a general practitioner or a family physician and take the above treatment with consent. Use only a mild soap, such as a baby soap or creamy soap for washing hands. Strictly avoid exposure to any detergents, medicated soaps, harsh soaps and hand sanitizer, as they may worsen the condition. This should provide you with instant relief from your current problem. However, after your examinations are over and the condition subsides, you shall need to consult a dermatologist in person. So, that further tests such as a patch test may be conducted to elucidate a suspected cause of this contact allergy. Patch test after subsidence of the acute allergic phase. Avoidance of exposure to medicated or harsh soaps, detergents and chemical sanitizer. Revert back after 10 days to a dermatologist online.-."

        "output": "Hi. This is a chronic fever, which is called as pyrexia of unknown origin when we are unable to ascertain a cause. As your blood tests and x-ray are normal, lung infection is ruled out. Conditions causing chronic fever are numerous. Also, certain infections like tuberculosis, HIV and malignancies can cause it. But, in your case it is unlikely as there is no weight loss or other risk factors, neither you have an x-ray abnormality. Now, we move to the lymph nodes. Do you have any lymph node swelling.  If yes, then get it tested. Try to get an ultrasound of abdomen to rule out lymphadenopathy. Get a urine routine and culture as sometimes a mild urine infection can get unnoticed and cause fever. Get a blood glucose and renal function test too. If everything comes normal, then we should look for anemia. A low hemoglobin can cause low grade fever and fatigue. Fungal infections usually cause severe illness. To confirm if it is a fungal infection, a blood culture is required. For further information consult a general medicine physician online ."

I have been tested for HIVAIDS, STDS and everything else so to say and the blood results are all normal. I have not had intercourse for almost a year. This is my story. Please help me On the 29th of August 2011, I experienced extreme abdominal pain, which prevented me from standing up and walking. I immediately went to my local doctor, who referred me to the ER department, thinking it may be appendicitis. At the ER blood and urine tests were taken and the doctors found that there was nothing wrong. They suspected to see a tubular structure which according could be the appendix but insisted that it was not and thus decided to refer me to the Spectrum to do a few scans of my abdomen etc. The scans turned out normal, where only small cyst of normal size was found on or near my right ovary and a little bit of free fluid. These scans apparently were NORMAL. The doctors said that there s nothing to be concerned about and that this pain should go away soon. I was put on antibiotics in case of having caught a virus or some internal preventable infection and after almost a week of taking them, the pain became a little less, although it did not go away completely. I had to stop taking the antibiotics a little while after, as I started to experience some of the side effects such as nausea etc. At this point, seeing as my doctors believed that it may only be ovulation pain mittelschmerz I was relieved when I got my periods on the 13th September 2011, thinking that the pain soon after will go away. I was wrong. After my periods, on the seventh day, I had a normal shower and had some dead blood after it, which lasted for two days. I believed that this was normal seeing as how it sometimes happens after my periods. However, whilst this was the case and whilst I am still convinced that the brown spotting was normal because it sometimes happens before and after my periods, the pain continues to stay and has recently moved to the right side of my abdomen. Today, 23rd September 2011, 10 days after my last period and almost a month of this pain starting, I still have the pain like I have had since about a month ago. However, now it is solely on the right side, which I believe is exactly on the right ovary, where the normal sized cyst was found. The pain is not extreme, where I cannot move at all BUT it is quite uncomfortable, dull and to an extent quite hurtful if I could say. It is constantly there and even though it goes away for a couple of hours every now and then, when it comes back I can feel it on the right, somewhere either near or on my ovary, which then moves towards the inner side of the beginning of my outer vagina lips are. Two days ago, when the pain was there again, it even numbed my thighs and half of my right leg. I went to see the doctor immediately after this the next morning and she had told me that it is nothing. I asked her if it could possibly be endometriosis and she said \u2018no and that I have nothing to worry about. But, how can I not worry when this pain has been constant for almost a month.  I do not exercise, lay mostly in my bed to relax and it is still there. I cannot move around too much because it keeps coming back after I move and doctors are not doing anything to find out what it could really be. They just keep telling me that it could be ovulation pain or something else that I should not be concerned about. However, even though this could be the case, I do not think that ovulation pain could last every day for a whole month. Nevertheless, blood tests, urine tests and even scans have not shown anything wrong with me and even an internal scan of my pelvic, abdomen and vagina turned out to be fine except for that small normal size cyst and the free fluid, which they said is also normal. What could this be.  I am planning to go and get a few more tests but do not know what I should be testing for. PLEAS HELP",

        "output": "Hi  Good evening. I am Dr Shareef answering your query.There is nothing to be nervous about H Pylori. This is a kind of infection of the mucosa of stomach, and it could be cured easily. This could also be the reason for the symptoms of GERD like burning in stomach due to gastritis. The pain on the right side could be an extension of the pain from gastritis, or could be due to calculus disease of the gall bladder.If I were your doctor, apart from treating you with antibiotics for the H pylori infection, I would also advise you for a proton pump inhibitor drug for a symptomatic relief. I would also advise you for some modification in your diet like more of roughage, enough liquids, avoidance of oily, fried, and fast food and regular routine exercises like morning walk depending on your medical fitness. Avoidance of alcoholic beverages and smoking is an essential part of the treatment. Apart from this, I would also advise you for an ultrasound abdomen to rule out chances of any gall stone disease. I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physiciantreating doctor in further management of your problem.

        "output": "Your cough was probably caused by a viral infection which is quite common. But it is probably unrelated to the hives or acute urticaria that your doctor has treated you for. He has additionally prescribed antibiotics to be on the safer side and has tried to cover both for the cough and the hives. Please stop metronidazole and the other antibiotics after completing the five day course. The constipation could have been caused due to the normal intestinal bacterial flora being disturbed. Taking plenty of curd or yogurt should help."

The injury happened while i was leaning and resting my body over the front of the car, the front part of the car i was leaningresting on was against my lower abdomen. I was really straining to undo something using my hands and kept going till i felt something like a little balloon getting blown up in my lower abdomen around the groin area. I have been in and out of hospital and seen general surgeons, orthapedic surgeons, nerve and mascular specialists and also physio therapist, they have found a hernia but said that it is small. 2 months ago as it has been going on till now but not as bad, the pain was unbareable, the put in a scope and found that i had alot of adhesions, so they cleared all that up. Now i am waiting for a hernia surgery but the pain is extremely sharp and this travels all the way to my left testicle and also makes the vain in the shaft of the penis, the pain gets that bad that those areas can not be touched and takes about 3-4 days to start to become bareable, when the pain is there i am unable to put too much pressure on my left leg, walking short distances, sitting on flat and hard seats, sitting in car seats all aggrevate this and make the pain unbareable. The doctors and specialists are unable to find what the cause of all this is. I am desperate. I need to work this out and get my health back, i want the pain i have been suffering for 14months gone, i want to get back to work and support my family, i want my life back. Please help.",
        "output": "Hi Good afternoon. I am Dr Shareef answering your query.Discomfort in the testis could be due to ignored repeated trivial trauma specially in your case due to your job profile, which causes inflammation causing paindiscomfort in the same. Testis being an intra-abdominal organ embryo-logically, brings the nerve supply to it from above, and so the pain in the testis is frequently radiatedfelt as a discomfort in the abdomenpelvis area. If I were your doctor, after a thorough physical examination I would advise you for the following1 Support your testes with properly fitting under garments.2 Avoid standing for prolonged period, and avoid lifting heavy weight if you do.3 Advise you for a routine blood tests like a CBC, AEC, HbsAG, HIV test and a urine routinemicroscopic examination followed by a culture and sensitivity report if need be.4 Avoid indulgence in any sexual activity if you are active sexually which would prevent further trivial trauma if any to the testes, apart from precipitating any kind of infection if present.5 Prescribe a broad spectrum antibiotic along with an anti inflammatory drug, and a proton pump inhibitor. The antibiotic could change after the report of the culture sensitivity test of urine.Hernia is a separate entity and has to be dealt with separately by your surgeon. However, a ureteric stone has to be ruled out with the help of an abdominal scan which also gives rise to abdominal pain radiating to the penis and testis on that particular side.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physiciantreating doctor in further management of your problem.

The doctor first said I have gastro intenstinal bacteria and ordered an IV and mallox, at what not to flush out the crap literally. Then I was also given an ultrasound to look at my lower abdomen because of the pain. They found loose fluid and said I probably had an ovarian cyst rupture.

        "output": "Hello Thank you for the query. Usually such strong pain as you have described might be caused by a stone sticked in ureter. This pain is described as sharp strong pain, radiating from back side to groin. It can be associated with symptoms like nausea, sweats and fever. This pain can come and go spontaneously as it only appears when little stone is migrating from kidney to urinary bladder. Abdomen ultrasound should answer if there are any stones in kidney but no always does and if there is any hydronephrosis. Urine tests might be normal when there is no symptoms, but recently after pain attack there should be some erythrocytes if you are dealing with kidney stones. Your symptoms might be also caused by ovarian cyst. Trans vaginal ultrasound should tell if there are any. If this two diseases will be ruled out, there are other possibilities, that is why full blood work should be performed, and abdomen CT if necessary. Hope this will help."

Triple antibiotic ointments and other commonly used products I cannot eat red meat anymore, something I enjoyed as I now have severe migraines even with the smallest of portions. The smell of cooked meat is unbearable whereas before I had no problem with it.

I have been on so many antibiotics in the first year since the changes they are no longer effective. My doctor asked to have blood work to find the cause of the severe rashes they covered from my abdomen to my neck, my ears, and my arms. The whole left side of my back, and from my hip to my knee on one side of my body at different times, always in large areas. I tested negative for diabetes, and negative for HIV. I was told the only thing notable was that a small part of my thyroid left in me after surgery had formed nine cold masses around it, and that my liver levels were slightly elevated. Was on seizure medicine for many years which stimulated the liver, no longer taking medication. My thyroid levels were normal. I am at a loss of the cause of the rashes, and intolerance to foods I used to be able to eat.

Last summer I had to stop using an anti-perspirant as it caused my underarms to itch. Also, many dryer sheets cause itching. I m 68 & my skin is thinning somewhat due to age, I suppose. Can Vitamin D be causing these skin problems.",
        "output": "hi sirmadam,Thanks for your question on HealthApp.An allergic reaction to vitamin D causes the immune system to develop a defense against the supplement because of a hypersensitivity to the vitamin. The immune system reacts by creating Immunoglobulin E, or IgE antibodies, that attack the vitamin supplement, according to the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology. Various other chemicals are released in the body, causing inflammation in the throat, lungs, sinuses and skin. The primary chemical that causes inflammation is histamine, a hormone that helps fight off infection.After ingesting a vitamin D supplement, hives can develop within minutes or up to two hours. Hives can occur because of too much histamine released in the skin. The rash appears as welts that appear in clusters anywhere on the body. The rash causes the skin to swell and has defined borders, although the rash can appear in any shape or size.Eczema is a chronic skin disorder where the skin is hypersensitive to various triggers, much like an allergy, according to MedlinePlus. If you experience an allergic reaction to vitamin D and you are pre-disposed to eczema, the allergic reaction can cause an eczema flare-up. Eczema appears primarily behind the legs, arms and on the face in blisters. The rash can crack, weep and crust-over if scratched.Consult your GP for further treatments.hope this was helpful.have a healthy day."

        "instruction": "Hello - my daughter, who is 17 years old, has white blisters on her tonsils and a rash all over her body face, neck, arms, stomach, back and legs She does not have a temperature, nor a headache. Doctor took blood and her WBC was slightly high 11.9, but everything else was normal range. I have given you an overview below of what has occurred. We have been to the doctor three times Sept. 21st, 26th and 29th. The first trip to the doctor s office, was for a sore throat and white blisters on tonsils. NP prescribed amoxicillin and cetirizine. This did not clear up the sore throat or blisters. Second trip to the doctor s office was on Sept. 26th. Doctor prescribed a stronger dose of antibiotic Cefdinir and Prednisone. On Thursday, Sept. 28th, my daughter developed a rash, but only on her chest and stomach, a little bit on her face. I called the doctor s office and the nurse said to stop taking the Cefdinir and Prednisone - no doctors were in it was 4pm and I made an early morning appointment for Friday, Sept. 29th. By Friday, the rash spread to her back, arms and legs as well as still on her face, chest and stomach. The doctor thought it might be mononucleosis or possibly Herpes. He took blood and sent me the results this morning Saturday, Sept. 30. So here we are and I still do not know what she has or how to treat it. Can you help me.  Thanks very much for any response.

        "output": "hi sirmadam,swollen tongue can be easily treated by the help of ayurveda.Let me advice you about tongue swelling.Swollen tongue is actually an abnormal condition in the tongue occurring due to tongue inflammation, where either a part or the entire tongue gets enlarged, and fatter than the normal tongue size. It is true that tongue in its swelling conditions is taken as a kind of defence mechanism which helps in fighting against the infection and aids in healing. However, when there is an excessive swelling for longer time the swollen tongue can be actually very much harmful.It must be mentioned that tongue inflammation or the swollen tongue condition can result from the excessive fluid accumulation in the tongue tissues and termed as Angioedema. This swollen tongue can also occur due to excess deposit of abnormal substances like the amyloid protein and also can be result from any kind of allergic reactions to certain medicines.Symptoms Of Swollen Tongue-1. Enlarged, puffy tongue due to excessive swelling2. Difficulty breathing when tongue swelling outgrows to the throat or the air passage.3. Discoloration or redness seen sometimes due to inflammationProblem while swallowing foods.Causes of swollen tongue-1. Tongue sores usually caused due to virus.2. Strep infections can cause swollen tongue.3. Sometimes burning of tongue while eating food in hot conditions can lead to the trauma and swollen tongue.4. Vitamin D deficiency can also lead to swollen tongue and other tongue inflammation.5.Certain allergic reactions can cause swelling in tongue.6. Patients suffering from genetic disorders like down is syndrome, are likely to have swollen tongue.7. Tongue cancer, leukaemia etc causes swollen tongue.8. Breakdown of skeletal muscle tissue or Rhabdomyolysis can cause swollen tongue.9. Hypothyroidism, amyloidosis etc can also lead to tongue swelling.10.Excessive alcoholism and smoking also causes swollen tongue.Next i am going to tell about the home remedies you should follow-1. Take enough of butter, soups, yoghurt, gravy and broths in regular diet. In fact try to switch on the semi-solid foods which help in providing relaxation in swollen tongue condition.2. Cold temperature helps in reducing the tongue swelling. So keep some ice cubes in your mouth and relax yourself.3. Include celery sticks in diet and provide enough relief to your swollen tongue.4. Make a dilute solution of turmeric in a warm glass of water and gargle with the solution to get relief from tongue inflammation and swollen tongue.5. Drinking small amount of water at regular intervals help you ease the swelling of tongue.6. Placing a spoon of sugar on the tongue also help you in reducing the swelling of tongue.7. Soak some rosemary, mint and aniseeds in a bowl of water overnight, strain the mixture and use it as a mouthwash in the morning. This will help you greatly.8. It is also advised to take less amount of salt and prevent excessive production of saliva, which might cause difficulty swallowing with a swollen tongue.9.Aloe Vera as Herbal Home Remedy for Sore Tongue,because of the anti-inflammatory properties, Aloe vera is used as a herbal home remedy for sore tongue to reduce pain and inflammation. All you can do is extract the gel from an Aloe vera leaf and apply it directly over the affected area in the tongue. You can also rinse your mouth few times with the aloe vera juice for reducing the inflammation.10.Baking soda, due to its anti inflammatory property can be used as a natural home remedy for sore tongue. You need to make a paste by adding \u00bd tablespoon of baking soda to a glass of water and apply it in the affected portion of the tongue or the mouth.11.Honey is a wonderful home remedy for sore tongue. You can apply honey to the affected area in the mouth for better healing of the sores. Honey can also be added to lukewarm water for rinsing the mouth twice or thrice a day.Use any of this home remedies to get a excellent results.Hope i was helpful.Have a healthy day."

It can also be worsened due to climatic conditions. There are blood allergen tests and skin prick allergen tests which can determine what are you allergic to, so that you can take necessary precautions. For your symptoms you can take tablet montelukast FX 10MG once in the night for about 14 days. This tablet is a combination of montelukast and fexofenadine which will definitely take care of your hives, runny nose and other symptoms. Also do a spirometry which shows functional capacity of the lungs. Allergies can also involve the lower airways causing asthma. It is a test in which you are required to blow into a machine to test your lungs functional capacity. If spirometry shows reversible obstruction then you must be started on inhalers also. Widhing you good health"

My pharmacy that I have gone to for years and have had Lisinopril HTC 20 filled for years now says it is. I have not have any trouble taking Lis. Usually I react to meds with hives. What do you think.",
        "output": "Hi, I understand your concern. Hydroxyzine is an anti-histamine which is also used to treat tension and anxiety due to its sedative effects. Hydrochlorothiazide is a diuretic med used to treat hypertension. This is not the same as hydroxyzine. So, you can use it safely as long as it is not in your allergy list.

        "instruction": "Please describe the subjective and observational consequences of a Herx-Heimer reaction. I had one for 3 terrifying days, & the bizarre & unusual things that my body was doing were unbelievable. Since my family was away I video taped much of it on a poor quality camera. Luckily the camera and a ruler for scale were able to clearly show my hands swelling to more than double in size and vivid red dots appearing between each hand knuckle. Feet, too. The skin on my body seemed to whirr from the inside out & cover my body with new skin. Even the remains of a 52 staple abdominal scar was covered and looked 20 years old instead of 4. My old broken wrist felt like part of me. The skin turned absolutely white when they swelled x2 white like when a nurse uses latex to empty an arm of blood prior to surgery, only whiter. I had 72 hours of various bizarre involuntary small movements- tendons lengthening and bone realignment, with no more control than when a braindead woman yuck, but I saw it gives birth. At the end I was emotionally devastated but felt better than I had in 2 decades I have had Lyme for 31 yearsNow I know it was a H-H, something barely covered in my Med School Lectures  Syphilis..blah..blah..blah, silver for the wealthy, antibiotics now, blah, Tuskeegee, blah, tasteless jokes, blah, blah, now let s get back to Infectious Disease and Real Medicine . I couldn t diagnose myself but Curt Brown, MD did by phone in2 minutes. Best doctor & human being I ever knew- killed by the Red Cross to save a few pennies on prescreening donated blood. Gentle genius that he was, he immediately asked what antibiotic I had just started. How did he know.  Because there was an epidemic of Lyme disease in Connecticut & he was invited to join the board looking into it.. It was 1986 and he was uninvited back for suggesting that Lyme would be the next big disease, that people s lives + brains would soon be infected and the the blood supply most certainly already a vector- he also recommended how infected women could give birth to healthy babies. Doxy, right.  he guessed. The spirocete maybe in your CFS already and in your brain. The H-H is from its death and the contents spilling into your circulatory system You need it IV now, I ll help. Sadly for the world this fine Physician and Hospital Medical Director died very soon thereafter- he had received 4 units of blood US Red Cross tainted with Aids a few months earlier. Probably THE FASTEST exposure to death method there is- not a needle stick but LITERS of HIV virus poured into his veins- and his wife and children as lovely and trusting as him- litigation out of the question because no one could possibly play Russian roulette with people s lives. Meanwhile Europe had been testing donated blood for a year. But, I digress in my anger. I never finished school- never gave birth- I was too sick. 23 years later I am hanging IV s around the clock. Years of fights with insurance companies delayed that thanks to that shorthorned whore, Dr. Steele formerly of Yale. One of those who accepted utside money to sit on a many and minimize the threat of Lymes. He was BANNED from the second panel which could only include scientists, experts and those not receiving money from Aetna or any other insurance Co. Steele made more money consulting for Aetna for all those years than you ll make legally as an honest man in your lifeime. I can walk again, but I can t dress myself, or read a book at one sitting. My IVs began too late because of chicken-hearted MDs & doctors like Alan Steele. I WANT a H-H reaction, I d like Many of them. I felt better for weeks, maybe months after my only one on 400 mg of doxy. I ve ALL the standard PO antibiotics and am moving thru the next standards IV CLaforan best., Vancomycin & Rocephin did nohing. I am saving Doxy for last and if it does nothing I will carry on or be carried through my stepdaughter s wedding in May and then schedule an appointment for either of those helpful Clinics in Belgium or Oregon. This search for a near normal life has cost me many worldly goods and I could happily carry on as a healthy 60 year old, but I refuse to be wheeled in for a nice game of Jeopardy and then to some institutions idea of food. I will happily compensate you for REAL help or new ideas. I have been to Boston, New York, Yale, Atlanta, 2 of the Mayo locations, L.A., St. Louis, and a ream of nternet Clinics where I have learned to Visualize a tidy autopsy on some of these paraprofessionals. I have enough funds left to compensate your group if you are in anyway helpful. I have enough Real Estate to reward you beyond your dreams if you can get me up and about- and enough political connections to be sure that ANYONE with late stage Lyme Disease will think of your group the way Salk comes to mind for all of we mothers who worried ourselves sick every summer until he shielded our children from harm.

        "output": "Whenever any allergen is made to enter body through any route and it manifests reactions, re entry of same similar allergens knowingly or unknowingly, into same body manifests reaction manifolds and it keeps on multiplying.The basic rule is NIDAANPARIVARJAN in sanskrit language i.e. avoidance of cause. Still if it can not be avoided anti allergics are given. If not found effective, immunity of body should be raised to resist allergies.Here Ayurveda has an important and sustainable treatment to offer by way of natural herbal combos. It enhances immunity by balancing vitiation of Vata Pitta humors which are culprits to cause allergy.Simple herbs like Neem, curcumin, Manjishtha etc are effectively controlling such conditions practically. It may act slow but what have fast acting toxic drugs done so many years.  So its prudent to opt for herbals which are safe and have no interaction problem with other current drugs. These raise strength of immunity in the body.If interested, may write direct question for further advise and treatment. Pl inform little medical history and latest reports, if any."

I also take Amaryl for diabetes and Labetalol for High blood pressure. Five months ago I started Cimzia for RA. Three weeks ago I got Coxsackie virus. After the Coxsackie dried up a week ago, I developed Urticaria. With the urticaria I have been on and off my medications. My PCP believes that the urticaria might be triggered by the combination of Cimzia and Arava. On the other hand, my immunologist thinks that the urticaria is a consequence of the coxsackie virus. My blood tests seem to be normal, excluding my sugar which is over 200 because of the prednisone that I have been taken for the urticaria. I am also taking allegra, cingulair, zantac, zyrtec, and sometimes benadryl. However, my urticaria gets worse and worse. The patches and itchiness is indescribable. At this point, I do not know what to do or what to take to control the symptoms of the urticaria. I went to the ER twice. The ER doctors control the urticaria symptoms while I am at the hospital but once I get back home, all symptoms persist. Assuming the urticaria is post viral caused by coxsackie, how long does it usually last.  On the other hand, If the urticaria is caused by the interaction of medications, should I cleaned up my system from the medicines and start from scratch. I have previously used a medication to clean up my system from Arava. Will that make the urticaria go away.",

Sugarcandy powder is also given but not in your case since you are diabetic.For curing sugar Meshashringi and Karela capsules are given to my patients.All above are pure herbals, without side effects and can be used for very long time.

        "output": "Its a kind of allergy caused by many kinds of foods, stings, external factors etc. Patient himself or herself is the best judge to find how it triggers.As per ayurveda, we have a clear principle that it is caused by Pitta and Capha vitiation. These are two basic humors of body. All the causes searched by modern science are basically Pitta and kapha vitiation.Nomenclature and principles apart, patients do not need to take drugs which cause side effects. Instead avoid known triggers and take Turmeric powder and Neem leaves Azadirachta indica plus sugar candy powder if not diabetic. Mixture of these powders removes hives.One classic prepared Ayurvedic powder called HARIDRA KHAND alone is capable of treating hives. This is little smelly and mildly unpalatable but when one is cured without side effects, its soul soothing. Hundreds of my patients in three decades those passed felt a sigh of relief with this simple medicine after they wasted a lot of money on allergy tests and side effect causing injections and medicines.So my own patients believe in this medicine which is also having sustained effect because it corrects the balance of humors.Hope it helps.

I can no longer stand a bra strap or purse on my shoulders or the pain and itching will begin. I dread the night as it gets worse.",

        "instruction": "I had my gallbladder removed 11 days ago, 3 Days after surgery I noticed a rash all over my stomach and one day later I started getting a rash on my arms. Was told by surgeon to take benadryl, that I most likely had an allergic reaction to the soap they used. Took it for two days and was fine, but after another two days of stopping benadryl I began itching in the same places.",
        "output": "You have not mentioned if you are taking any kind of medicines or not. If allergen is present, Benadryl withdrawl would again cause rashes. It is important to find out cause of rashes. Stop use of soap and see again.After gall bladder removal excess bile in blood stream also causes rashes, hives etc on the body. This is very commonly found.In Ayurveda Bile is called Pitta which when vitiated causes rashes, hives, itches etc. In India its managed by giving Turmeric, Neem leaves and Sugarcandy powders mixed equally. Only turmeric or combo of either Neem or Sugarcandy also works. Preferable is all the three mixed. If diabetic, Sugarcandy is avoided. Neem is Azadirachta indica. Alternatively HARIDRA KHAND - a classic Ayurvedic herbal medicine alone works well. No side effects. My patients were always benefitted by these.Hope it is helpful to you too. These small wonders of Ayurveda has the potential to relieve the humanity of such problems."

He even found he could not do wood working with walnut wood. Allergy testing does not show immune system response, so these are anaphylactoid not anaphylactic. This has gotten to be very debilitating as standard allergy meds knock him out for 16-20 hrs. So he can not work. Could the medications be causing the sensitization.",
        "output": "Many academicians have analyzed your type of questions and have genenerated a lot of information whether or not this causes allergy.Analyses have not fetched the cure because of diverse opinions and failure to find a solid approach.Only Ayurveda has the answer by orally taking safe herbals over some months or even more than a year and find enhanced immunity to prevent such allergens from making a reaction in your body.But its not less than a feat to gulp pure herbals being unpalatable in taste, coarse looking and reminding of pre historic era. Who cares about scientific sanctity of such herbs. Though, of late people are switching to Ayurveda successfully to find an answer. There are companies like Himalaya and others who contributed a lot to translate findings in modern terms.If I were your doctor, I would straightway advise you to try Haridra Khand and Kantkaryavaleh, Neem and Haridra, manjishtha capsules etc.to find side-effect-less solutions.

If she has anaphylaxis, I would suggest you to have a autoinjector epinephrine handy at home. This is more important as she has always had 8 intubations so far. Early administration of epinephrine can prevent more serious or fatal reaction.4. If she has recurrent angioedema, I usually prescribe my such patients daily antihistamines like cetirizine or levocetirizine for 4-6 weeks, which can prevent some episodes.5. For diagnosis, I usually suggest my patients investigations like CBC with ESR, CRP, stool and urine examination, serum total IgE, etc. To identify allergy, I would suggest specific testing for allergies. 6. I would like to mention here is that even if you give drug like epinephrine at home, it is necessary to take her to hospital immediately after development of such reaction. Please do not delay to call emergency services as both anaphylaxis and angioedema when affects larynx are dangerous conditions.Hope above suggestions will be helpful to you.Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at HealthApp.Wish your daughter the best of the health ahead.Thank you &"

What are her anxiety symptoms. c. What is the cause of her anxiety.  Any particular stressful event.  d. What is frequency of her asthma symptoms.  What are the symptoms of her asthma.  Wheezing, difficulty in breathing, fast breathing.  Does she have hyprventilation related to anxiety. e. What are her nose symptoms - running nose, congestion, sneezing, etc. f.

Above details would help me to know about her and to make suggestions for her more specifically.At present, from your provided details, I would suggest you as follows1. I would suggest her spirometry with post-bronchodilator reversibility testing. It will help to confirm diagnosis of asthma as well as to know her lung capacity. Sometimes, an adolescent can have asthma-like symptoms due to anxiety, which will be diagnosed with spirometry testing.2. Based on spirometry report, her doctor would also decide severity of her asthma. It will also help the doctor to decide whether she needs regular medicationsinhalers or medicationsinhalers for as-and-when-needed basis.3. I would also suggest her allergy testing for common inhaled allergens house dust mites, molds, pollens, animal dander, insect proteins, etc and common food allergens milk, egg, peanut, tree nuts, wheat, soy, fish, shellfish, etc. This will help to know if she has allergies as well as to identify the substances causing allergies to her. 4. Weight loss is not a common feature of asthma-allergies. It could be due to poor appetite related to anxiety or other causes. Please get her weight regularly monitored by her doctor, so if weight loss is significant, other disorders could be thought about.5. I would suggest her regular use of antacids like ranitidine or omeprazole to reduce vomiting and gastritis symptoms.6.

For symptom control, I would agree with hydroxyzine Atarax and Cetirizine Cetzine.3. I would also suggest you to apple calamine lotion or moisturizing cream application over the itchy areas as well as dry skin.4. Please do not scratch the itchy areas as scratching would aggravate itching.5. As long as ESR is concerned, I would like to mention that ESR is very non-specific in general. There are so many possible causes of elevated ESR. Moreover, there is no specific treatment for elevated ESR, rather, treatment of the cause would normalize the ESR.So please do not worry about ESR at present. ESR can be elevated simply because of anemia low hemoglobin levels as well.6.

I told the doctor he was allergic to penicillian, and she put him on this medication over a week ago. 24 hours after the last dose, he suddenly broke out in hives. I took him to his doctor and she gave him prednizone and told me to keep him dosed with benedryl, and claritin. I have also given him several collidal oatmeal baths and kept him covered with calamine lotion. His hives are getting so much worse, they look like large donuts with white ridges and deep purple centers. The hives range from dime size to five inches across. He suddenly started complaining of stomach pain and began vomiting about thirty minutes ago. Should I take him into urgent care, or is this typical.  He is not running a fever, and was drinking only water since dinner last night. His stomach is hurting, and he is very lethargic, more-so than I expect from benedryl. He is responsive, just out of it. What should I do.",

It is possible to develop allergic reaction to antibiotics like penicillins, cephalosporins, or, scientifically, any drug. Unfortunately, it is usually very difficult who will develop allergic reaction to which drug. In case of your son, I think, it is possible that your son has developed reaction to omnicef.2. I would agree with treatment so far, steroid Prednizone, antihistamine Benadryl & Claritin & local treatments like calamine lotion-oatmeal baths. I would like to make clear that benadryl is not only to keep him dosed, it is also a treatment of hives.3. As he is very lethargic, I would suggest you to take him into urgent care, as lethargy that is more than sedation could not be taken lightly. There are many possible causes of lethargy, from simply combined sedation of all antihistamines to more serious causes like dehydraion, etc.So it is important that he is examined by a doctor and then receive further treatment.So for my such patient, I would suggest to take him into urgent care to get examined by a doctor.Hope above suggestions will be helpful to you.Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at HealthApp.Wish your son the best of the health ahead.Thank you &"

I started taking Mucinex DM and then broke out in hives. I thought the Mucinex might be causing the hives, so I stopped taking that. Since the sore throat and earache was not going away, I went to my doctor last Monday. He said I might have strep throat, but did not test me for it. He wrote Pharnygitis on my doctor is note for work and put me on an antibiotic Amoxicillan 500 MG capsules to be taken 3 times a day. I have been taking that, but the hives keep appearing every day. Not sure if the hives are an allergic reaction to both medicines or if it is just a part of this viral infection. I have to take Benedryl every night to get relief from the itching.

As your hives started after taking Mucinex DM while having a sore throat with earache, I would think of either the infection itself or Mucinex DM.2. Although amoxycillin is a very common cause of hives, I would not think of amoxicillin you had hives even before taking amoxycillin.3. At this moment, it is difficult to find the exact cause of hives, it could be Mucinex DM, viral infection or strep infection. As you have already started amoxycillin, throat culture will not be helpful. There are many possible viruses causing such symptoms with hives, so I usually do not advise my such patients to go for testing for viruses, especially because there are no antiviral medicines for most of the viruses.4. Were I treating you, I would suggest you to complete the course of Amoxycillin and take an antihistamine like levocetirizine or cetirizine in morning and diphenhydramine Bendadryl that you are already taking, may cause sedation before going to bed at least for 7-10 days. If hives return after that, I would investigate my such patient for other causes of hives.5. I would also suggest you to apply calamine lotion over the itchy areas.

If she is really allergic to milk, taking any milk product be it curd, buttermilk, butter, milk biscuits, milk chocolates, etc can cause her allergic reactions.2. If she is not taking any milk products and still she develops allergic reactions, I would suggest allergy testing for other foods such as soy, ground nut, wheat, rice, egg, sea foods, tree nuts, etc. This will help you to identify the allergy, if any.3. Hives can occur even without allergies. Possible causes are viral infections, bacterial infections, parasites, drugs, etc.4. As she is getting hives since 2 months, I usually suggest my such patients investigations like serum total IgE, allergy testing for common allergens, complete blood counts, ESR, stool examination, urine examination, etc. However, before suggesting investigations, I always take a detailed history about her each and every symptom, diet, environment, drugs, etc etc. This may minimize requirement of investigations.5.

They should be given only for severe hives and that only on prescription of a doctor.4. I would agree with you that I would also suggest him allergy testing for food allergies. If he is allergic to food, that particular food should be avoided.Hope above suggestions will be helpful to you.Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at HealthApp.Wish your son the best of the health ahead.Thank you &"

        "output": "Hello,Thank you for posting your query on HealthApp.I appreciate your concern for your mother.Food allergy is an immune system reaction that occurs soon after eating a certain food. Even a tiny amount of the allergy-causing food can trigger signs and symptoms.The most common food allergy signs and symptoms includeTingling or itching in the mouthHives, itching or eczemaSwelling of the lips, face, tongue and throat or other parts of the bodyWheezing, nasal congestion or trouble breathingAbdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea or vomitingDizziness, lightheadedness or faintingIn some people, a food allergy can trigger a severe allergic reaction called anaphylaxis. This can cause life-threatening signs and symptoms, includingConstriction and tightening of airwaysA swollen throat or the sensation of a lump in your throat that makes it difficult to breatheShock with a severe drop in blood pressureRapid pulseDizziness, lightheadedness or loss of consciousness.This is a medical emergency and she should go to the nearest hospital if she gets an symptom suggestive of anaphylaxis.Food allergy should not be confused with food intolerance which is much more common and is a less serious condition that does not involve the immune system.In food intolerance one may be able to eat small amounts of problem foods without a reaction. By contrast, in a true food allergy, even a tiny amount of food may trigger an allergic reaction.Because a food intolerance may involve some of the same signs and symptoms as a food allergy does like nausea, vomiting, cramping and diarrhea , people may confuse the two.There are skin tests and blood tests to detect the foods your mother may be allergic to. A specialist in Internal Medicine or an allergy specialist will be able to arrange that.If you have further query, I am available.Best wishes for your mother is good health.Dr. Noble Zachariah"

Causative allergens can be food as well as non-food protein. you can undergo serum IgE level & absolute eosinophil count.

It took a while for me to even think it may be crab as I am lactose intolerant and kept wondering what dairy did I have to cause the reaction.I have seen an allergist and both skin and blood tests have come back negative for crab and other shellfish. Even though the tests have come back negative should I be concerned about anaphallxis and carry an EpiPen.  Either way I am not eating crab again.",
        "output": "Hello.Thank you for asking at HealthApp.I went through your history and would like to make following suggestions to you1. If your allergist has made diagnosis of anaphylaxis, it is highly desirable to carry Epipen as its prompt use can be life-saving should you have any episode of anaphylaxis. There is no specific test to diagnose anaphylaxis retrogradely, so diagnosis cn be assumed only after knowing the details of episodes.2. I usually think of diagnosis when more than one systems are involved - any two of gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, respiratory and skin.So, if you have only vomiting and diarrhea gastrointestinal associated with crab, and no other symptoms like fainting, hypotension, collapse, palpitation, cough, respiratory difficulty, wheezing, swelings, itching, hives, etc, I would not first think of anaphylaxis.As your allergy tests are also negative, I would first think of non-allergic intolerance or something like food poisoning.However, if you have any of the above mentioned symptoms, anaphylaxis would be my first consideration, in that case, Epipen will be a need for you.Hope above information will help you.Thank you &"

I would like to mention here that most of long standing hives and swellings angioedema are non-allergic. So if her all allergy testing is negative, I would not suggest her to think of allergy to something, rather than they may be related to abnormal functioning of immune system. As both celiac and multiple sclerosis are non-allergic immune-related disorders, chances are very high that her hives are non-allergic.2. I usually suggest such patients daily antihistamines like cetirizinehydroxyzine regularly. The dose of them can be adjusted according to response of her symptoms. 3. In general, I would suggest her avoidance of too spicytoo hot diet. Also please activities causing excessive sweating and hot water baths.4. Personally, I would also suggest her tight-fitting, woolen or synthetic type of clothes. In my opinion, loose-fitting, cotton clothes will be the best.5. I would suggest her a diet rich in vitamins and minerals plenty of green leafy vegetables, fruits, sprouts, etc which will help her immunity in a long run.6.

Were I treating her, I would suggest her investigations like complete blood counts, ESR, CRP, urine and stool routine & microscopic examination. These would give clue to cause of her symptoms.4. If she has no hives and only repeated episodes of swelling, I would also suggest her to investigate for serum C4 levels to screen for hereditary angioedema.5.

The allergist basically told me to take Allegra, but it has not helped very much. It is very incapacitating. Are there doctors that specialize in hives.",
        "output": "Hello.Thank you for asking at HealthApp.I went through your history.As you are having hives for 5 months, I would call it chronic urticaria.There are many causes of chronic urticaria - physical factors like excessive sweating, contact with hotcold water, undue pressure over body parts, sun exposure, etc. There are other causes also like some infections, thyroid disorders, some drugs, etc.If Allergra is not working with you, personally I would suggest montelukast and levocetirizine in the morning and hydroxyzine before going to sleep. If this does not help, I would suggest you to consult an Allergist who will advise you some tests like CBC, ESR, thyroid testing, urine and stool examination, allergy testing, etc. Usually it is allergists or dermatologists who are trained and experienced in managing chronic urticaria.Actual treatment will depend upon the cause of your problem. As general measures, I would suggest you to wear loose, comfortable clothing and avoid tight or woolen clothing. I would also suggest to avoid excessive sweating producing activities.Hope this will be helpful to you.Wish you a fast recovery and the best of the health."

I would like to know other details like duration of hives, any other allergic diseases, any relation to food or drugs, etc.At present, if you do not want to use calamine lotion, I would suggest you to give her an antihistamine like hydroxyzine or cetirizine for 3-5 days. You can use both calamine lotion and an antihistamine drug, that will be better.As they are related to diaper areas, I would suggest you to change diapers more frequently and also change the type of diapers, if possible.If this does not help, I would suggest you to consult a pediatrician, who will ask in detail about her problem and can examine her hivesrashes and can come to some conclusion.Hope this will be helpful to you.Wish your daughter the best of the health."

        "output": "Hello.Thank you for asking at HealthApp.Since you are having itching without hives, the causes can be non0allergic, too. Most common causes are dry skin and micronutrient vitamins & minerals deficiencies but other causes can be also there like chronic liver disease, chronic kidney disease, thyroid disorders, some drugs, etc.Hence I would suggest you to regularly apply moisturizers over body and take nutritional supplements containing especially vitamin E, vitamin A, zinc & selenium. Please try to wear loose, cotton clothes if possible and avoid woolen, tight clothing. Please try to avoid activities causing excessive sweating. If this does not help, I would suggest you to go for investigations like CBC, ESR, serum creatinine, blood urea, prothrombin time, serum proteins including albumin, thyroid function, urinalysis, etc after consulting your doctor.I hope this will be helpful to you.Wish you the best of the health."

        "output": "Hello.Thank you for asking at HealthApp.One most important thing I would like to know is whether you itch without hivesskin lesionsurticaria or with them. If you have hivesurticaria, I would say you are having chronic urticaria. I would suggest you to consult an Allergist who will perform some tests for physical urticaria and suggest some blood tests like total blood count, ESR, serum anti-thyroglobulin antibodies, anti-nuclear antibodies, anti-thyroperoxidase antibodies and urine & stool examination. Some of these tests are for autoimmune disorders. Then he can treat accordingly.But if you are not having skin lesions at all and only itching, I would not think of allergy at first. The causes are many like dry skin, nutritional deficiencies of vitamins & minerals, diabetes mellitus, thyroid disorders, chronic liver disease, chronic kidney disease, etc. So I would suggest you to consult a physician who may suggest you tests like CBC, ESR, blood sugar, SGPT, total proteins including albumin & globluin, urea, creatinnine and urine & stool routine and microscopic examination. Then he can treat you accordingly.Hope this will be helpful to you.Wish you the best of the health."

What is something unusual is you do not have significant itching and also puffiness of eyes do not improve with antihistamines.

I am wondering if it may be palm oil",
        "output": "Hello.Food allergy can be due to anything. Personally the most practical way to identify the food causing allergy is to keep a food diary. I would suggest you to keep a note of each and every food your daughter consumes with time and date and also note the time and date of symptoms. Please note ingredients of each food items too. Your keen observation will help you to identify the food causing allergic symptoms.I would like to let you know that most common foods causing allergy are - milk, peanut, treenuts, soy, eggs, shellfish, fish & meat. However, it is possible to have allergy for any of the foods, so food diary is indeed a handy tool.Rast tests are used for diagnosis of food allergy but they are not 100. It is possible to have a negative Rast test despite having allergy to food and also vice versa.Also, sometimes a child can have non-allergic reaction to a food, which cannot be picked up in laboratory tests. If this approach does not lead you to any conclusion, I would suggest you to consult an allergist-immunologist, who will ask you in very much detail and may suggest you some investigations. He may also advice you to keep a food diary.Hope this will help you.Wish your daughter the best of the health."

If it is the dust and the landlord is unwilling to remove it then it would have to be regularly cleaned each day. IF it is the fiber that would be difficult.YOu can consider allergy testing to determine what specifically is causing his reaction. This can be done as a blood test or skin testing.I hope this helps"

When it started to be your enemy is not mentioned in your question. Surely there will be a point of time when it all started. Now your duty is to find out from which anecdote this allergic reaction started. Then you will also find that it was after a particular conflicting incident in your life that this allergic changes started. This must be related to some unexpected shock, a separation, death of some loved ones etc. prior to the onset . All allergies have usually similar connections with the mind also. Unless this is brought to light, your exact mental make up cannot be understood. In Homoeopathy, we take into consideration your the mental, physical and general symptoms to find out your constitutional remedy. My advise is to approach an expert Homoeopath at the earliest. In Homoeopathy, we need not even avoid the material which causes allergy.

        "output": "Hello, It is not a difficult task to deal with alcohol allergy. Many people who have undergone the unwarranted symptoms may abstain from drinking alcohol. It is the best way of preventing any further alcohol related problems.The second most important factor is to know which alcoholic beverage he is drinking. For example if a person is allergic to grapes, than he should avoid drinking wine. If a person has allergy from yeast, then he should not drink beer and so on.Thirdly it is always preferable to limit the number of drinks.Antihistamines are sometime useful in reducing itching and hives. However they have to be used only after consulting the doctor. This is because antihistamines may cause drowsiness.For itching and skin troubles resulting from alcohol allergy, apply cold water or cold milk on the affected area. Wear lose fitting cotton clothes."

Everything started when I bought a new hair conditioner and decided to try it, some tingling started I panicked and started to think that I may develop a severe allergic reaction I heard of Hair dye allergies before. However, nothing happened, the tingling sensations stopped long before I washed it of. Sadly, these thoughts have not left my head... So, I decided to search for information on the subject, when, why it happens, who tend to suffer from it... As they say we fear of the unknown... It did not help me at all, it worsened my fears because I learnt that it can happen to anyone, anytime and anything can cause it... I am afraid to eat everything and even more afraid to take Xanax to relief the symptoms. What should I do before meeting with a therapist.  How can I help myself.  Maybe there are some facts that could help me to understand it and stop the panic.  By the way, I have never expierenced a severe allergic reaction, never had allergies but I tend to get hives if I scratch my skin.",
        "output": "Hello,The hives you get when you scratch your skin is called dermographism, and is a common condition. Having dermographism does NOT mean you will develop analphylaxis if you get an allergic reaction to say a colouring agent or you are at high risk of anaphylaxis.There are few options available to you1. See an Allergist for a Patch Test against the Standard Battery or Cosmetics. This involves a small amount of chemical being attached to the skin usually at the back for 48 hours, and see if you have any delayed hypersensitivities. This should lessen your fears and you will know if you are already sensitized to common chemicals.2. If you have had anaphylaxis in the past, you can get a blood test called mast cell tryptase MCT levels. If the levels are high, you are theoretically at high chance of developing severe allergic reactions to say insect stings etc.That you have never developed a severe allergic reaction, the MCT levels will likely be normal baseline values.I hope that was useful.Best Wishes."

Salbuatmol is a bronchodilator and needs to be repeated in severe attacks and can cause shivering in hands. It seems that in addition to salbutamol, you may need a steroid inhaler for more relief from your symptoms. I would suggest that you should get yourself clinically examined by your doctor and start a steroid inhaler like fluticasone under medical supervision. You can also discuss with your doctor of replacing salbutamol with salmetrol, which has longer duration of action and needs less frequent administration. Also take an antihistaminic like fenofexadine 120 mg once a day for some relief in cough. I hope this is helpful to you. Thanks."

And of course dust mites and dogs, and all outdoor stuff. He said I was having synergist effect so gave me drops. The hives did not happen last winter. Now it seems no matter what I eat I am getting scratchy throat , hives, stuffy nose and headache . I also have delayed reactions with stomaches. I have had many other health conditions for last five years. Anxiety is diagnosis with possible fibro. I seem to always feel sick and there is nothing for me to eat. I have many aches and pains that accompany these other symptoms along with what I can describe as a flushing rush through my body at times. I just am getting so frustrated.",

We had the apartment tested and there were no signs of CO in the apartment. They then said that there was probably a miss reading of the level of CO in his body, however how is this related to the severe allergy reaction that he had with the peanuts.",
        "output": "Hi cia-fmly, Thanks for writing to us, Generally there is no relation between CO level and peanut allergy you have stated above, The symptoms for peanut allergy could be different for different persons, An allergic response to peanuts usually occurs within minutes after exposure, and symptoms range from mild to severe. Peanut allergy signs and symptoms can include 1Skin reactions, such as hives, redness or swelling 2Itching or tingling in or around the mouth and throat 3Digestive problems, such as diarrhea, stomach cramps, nausea or vomiting 4Tightening of the throat 5Shortness of breath or wheezing 6Runny nose. 7 sometimes it may lead to anaphylaxis Carbon monoxide level in the body could have increased due to exposure to pollution , since our blood absorbs more  of CO than Oxygen easily . But since you have said that there were no chances of such , I think the report has to be reevaluated . I hope this was informational and wishing a good health to your son, Dr.G.Gayatri devi"

It now looks like I have mosquito bites all up the inside of my arms, around my armpits and up the sides of my torso. My back is also itchy as well as my tummy and under my breasts but there are not as many visible spots. Does this sound like an allergic reaction or could it be something contagagious.

That has passed. Also have been experiencing some odd discomfort at the base of my skull that seems to coincide with a weird sensation in my arms and hands.

        "output": "Hello, If the rash that you describe is red, itchy, has raised skin that you can feel, goes away after a few hours only for new ones to appear in their place, does not leave a mark or bruise, then this is acute urticaria. That you have had it for >6 weeks, makes it chronic urticaria. 80 of people with urticaria do not have allergy, although a pre-existing allergy to say house dust mite, pollens or shrimp does not make it more likely for this type of urticaria to appear. Infections, underlying thyroid problems, diabetes, inflammation inside the body can be several conditions, say endometriosis and stress makes these lesions appear and can last quite long. The treatment that you do not like is the right one, long-acting non-sedating antihistamines like allegra 180mg once in the morning, and cetirizine 10mg at lunch time or evening for 6 weeks max 3 months. Unless you continue on high dose antihistamines, this will recur. If you think you may have a thyroid problem, get TSH fT4 and TPO antibodies tested.

But as you mentioned no obvious jaundice, it is important to know that the other LFT parameters such as the enzymes are normal. An ultrasound liverGB is important at this stage.

        "output": "Hello Jawaria, I am sorry to note your present state. The condition that you describe is consistent with urticaria, and very itchy red hives that fade away but reappear within a few hours. Some attacks on the skin are raised and known as angioedema due to the chemical called histamine released from mast cells. These cells are present in the lips, tongue, skin, chest, gut etc and therefore wherever histamine gets released, you get the specific organ related symptoms. Another condition called urticarial vasculitis definitely needs to be excluded and moreso when there is no response to antihistamines. 80 of people with urticaria do not have any allergies which is the case with you. Long-acting non-sedating antihistamines like fexofenadine 180mg once daily plusminus cetirizine 10mg at lunchtimeevening is required for 3 months. Occasionally the treatment may need to be longer if there is a recurrence. Tests such as CBC, LFTs, renal profile, TSH TPOabs are standard investigations to exclude a secondary cause. Most people go into remission so do not worry. Thanks."

        "instruction": "As of tomorrow evening it will have been an entire week that i have had hives and swelling. It started last thursday, about two to three hrs after eatining various fish fry samples and two different samples of soup that I later found out had crayfish and lobster pieces in it. By friday evening the next night it had gotten worse even though I took loratidine and a few doses of hydroxyzine . I should note that Ive never had a seafood allergy so I didn t think anything of associating eating it with the problem. However I had started dicyclomine for a different issue 3 days prior to the onset of symptoms, which I discontinued immediately assuming it was the source of reaction... So that friday at dinner I didn t think it would be a big deal to eat steak and 3 shrimp. Within 2-3 i hrs my lipsface swelled up significantly. Took more hydroxyzine, the face swelling went down a bit by morning, but throughout that day, saturday, my hands and feet swelled up before my eyes to the point that making a fist hurt and became impossible, and when walking the bottoms of my feet hurt like I had bruises. That evening I switched to benadryl , added zantac , and began zyrtec instead of loratadine the next morning. Finally on Sunday went to urgent care as swellinghivesitching was intolerable. Was prescribed 5 days of 60 mg of prednisone and advised to continue antihistamine regiment, and given a epipen rx to keep on hand if breathing became difficult. Tomorrow will be 5th day on prednisone but still wake up with hives, severe itching and mild swelling. I almost used the epipen on Monday because I thought my chest was tight but after taking my dose of prednisone it eventually subsided. What do I do.  Prednisone helps but relief is mild and seems to be short lived, lasting a few hrs to 12 hrs max. I can t take it anymore. Why would I still have reaction if it was the seafood.  I have never had food allergy, only hives and mild swelling when taking various antibiotics. I did have a retreatment of a root canal by an endodontist on a molar the friday afternoon prior to the reaction almost an entire week went by with no hives, just mild swelling on cheek near tooth. Sorry for so many details but I need help Am I going to end up needing longer prednisone therapy.  Why hasn t it helped more by now.  Is that typical.  Any advice on what to do and expect.  I am a 27 yr old female, and am allergic to at least 10 antibiotics. Lastly, am in anatomy and have been working with a human cadaver and dissecting cats twice a week for several weeks, and earlierly on the day this all started I dissected a cow eye, but wore latex free gloves of course. I can t pinpoint the source so maybe I m still being exposed.  Im clearly going to have to go back to the doctor but I d like to know what to expect... Thanks in advance",
        "output": "Hello, You are clearly in distress with the acute generalised urticaria and angioedema episode and not helped by the fact that even prednisolone is taking its time. It is unlikely seafood allergy as the reaction does not proceed for so long even though all of us think of an event as the trigger. Most allergists though would like to ensure you have a blood test against the food panel that you had on the day and of course, shrimp crab lobster etc by a specific IgE blood test. Skin testing would be required at a later stage if blood tests are negative and you are off all antihistamines for 2 weeks. Saying that, I think all of them will be negative i.e., no allergy and at the same time you ought to get a blood test for CBC, LFT, creatinine, Mast cell tryptase, IgE, TSH TPO antibodies as the urticaria may have an autoimmune component. Prednisolone is reserved for the end if antihistamines do not work, but ultimately all will work once this acute phase is over. If you have required 30-40mg for more than 10 days, it is best you slowly taper it down and stop at 6 weeks. By then, fexofenadine 180mg and hydroxyzine 25mg at night only would have started to work. 20 do not respond to several antihistamines, and would need steroid sparing agents that must be discussed in detail with your doctor. Thanks."

Same period, I started experiencing the pain like burning sensation on my feet and having a feeling like crawling sensation on my body.

Of course, the HIV 1 and 2 ab test is the right test given the time frame when antibodies to the virus would have formed IF you have the reaction, but clearly not so but the most sensitive test remains HIV PCR or Viral load if you had more encounters since. The feeling that you describe can be scabies but would be evident on clinical examination, although a rash would mean this is urticaria. House dust mite and sea food allergy occasionally come up positive on blood tests, so if you really have reactions allergic when you have sea food the result is correct. You need a throat swab, HIV PCRVL and get seen by a specialist to lower the apprehension and hope things turn out well. As per the urticaria, long acting non sedating antihistamines for 3 months is the treatment. Thanks."

I take allergy shots, but these areas are not hives . The only secretions that come from these bumps are blood or clear fluid. If they ever do manage to heal, my skin is left scarred.",
        "output": "Hello, It does appear that you may have eczema although they are not intensely itchy. I hope these have not happened after the allergy shots in which case you need to get the concentration and content of the shots subcutaneous immunotherapy, I suppose reviewed by your Allergist. Long-acting antihistamines are recommended as a trial in the first instance. If you wish to exclude a fungal infection, a skin scraping needs to be taken and KoH preparation under Wood is lamp will reveal this. However, this is unlikely. I was not sure what you meant with the soap, but soaps are not recommended in dry skineczema as they dry the skin more. Try a soap substitute like Epaderm instead. Thanks."

Regarding your question , Montair contains the drug Montelukast,which is a Leukotriene [cys LT1] receptor antagonist.It blocks the action of leukotriene and prevents leukotriene mediated inflammation and bronchoconstriction.It is used in prophylactic therapy of mild to moderate asthma,in allergic rhinitis ,urticaria etc.Montelukast is usually safe drug.SideEffects are GI disturbances,headache & rashes.Few cases of Churg-Strauss syndrome have been reported. In a report FDA mentioned about the possibility of neuropsychiatric side effects with leukotriene modulator drugs like Montelukast. Although clinical trials only revealed an increased risk of insomnia, post-marketing surveillance showed that the drugs are associated with a possible increase in suicidal behavior and other side effects such as agitation, aggression, anxiousness, dream abnormalities and hallucinations, depression, irritability, restlessness, and tremor. Update here how your son stays ... Take care."

        "output": "Dear Mr Mehra, If your skin comes up in hives or circular red itchy lesions with central clearing that disappears on its own or after medications usually antihistamines in a few hours, you are most likely suffering from a condition called urticaria. This can also manifest with swelling under the skin or swelling on lips and tongue called angioedema. This is due to histamine release that may be spontaneous or a secondary trigger like scratching physical, cold or heat temperature change or related to hormonal imbalance. Conditions such as diabetes, underactive thyroid, or other autoimmune diseases make it worse when they are uncontrolled and a proportion of patients with urticaria have autoimmune urticaria while in others it may be idiopathic. High-dose long-acting antihistamines for 3 months minimum duration may provide extended relief when stopped but may need to be continued for longer. Fexofenadine 180mg and cetirizine 10mg twice daily is the usual choice. Thanks."

I m not allergic to anything else from the lettuce family, so that would be strange to be allergic, but possible I guess.",
        "output": "Hello, Cruciferous lettuce vegetables such as cauliflower, raddichio can have high levels of salicylate that can explain the itchy hives that you are having. However, this is usually a secondary trigger for people with idiopathic urticaria medical term for red, itchy hives that can feel swollen under the skin and is occasionally generalised i.e., whole body may be involved in hives. I would not suggest going on a strict low salicylate diet as it is a very difficult diet but you might want to stop raddichio in your diet and start taking either cetirizine 10mg max twice daily or Allergra 180mg for the next 2-3 weeks until all the hives have cleared up. Sometimes the treatment needs to be continued for 3 months so check with your doctor on the right antihistamines. If you do not high levels of salicylate sensitivity i.e., can tolerate other foods high in salicylates then do NOT go on a strict low salicylate diet. Sometimes in people with salicylate sensitivity, one may be able to tolerate some foods but not others in the high salicylate list which may be the same with you."

The blockage leads to increased pressure, impaired blood flow, and inflammation. If the blockage is not treated, gangrene and rupture breaking or tearing of the appendix can result. Most commonly, feces blocks the inside of the appendix. Also, bacterial or viral infections in the digestive tract can lead to swelling of lymph nodes, which squeeze the appendix and cause obstruction. This swelling of lymph nodes is known as lymphoid hyperplasia. Traumatic injury to the abdomen may lead to appendicitis in a small number of people. Genetics may be a factor in others. For example, appendicitis that runs in families may result from a genetic variant that predisposes a person to obstruction of the appendiceal lumen. [Top] Symptoms Symptoms of appendicitis may include * pain in the abdomen, first around the belly button, then moving to the lower right area * loss of appetite * nausea * vomiting * constipation or diarrhea * inability to pass gas * low fever that begins after other symptoms * abdominal swelling Not everyone with appendicitis has all the symptoms. The pain intensifies and worsens when moving, taking deep breaths, coughing, or sneezing. The area becomes very tender. People may have a sensation called downward urge, also known as tenesmus, which is the feeling that a bowel movement will relieve their discomfort. Laxatives and pain medications should not be taken in this situation. Anyone with these symptoms needs to see a qualified physician immediately. People With Special Concerns Patients with special conditions may not have the set of symptoms above and may simply experience a general feeling of being unwell.

It could be due a number of causes like bulged or herniated disc, wedge compression, vertebral collapse fracture or TB of spine or other cancers. You also mentioned that it was diagnosed to be from TB of spine. Has it been confirmed by a tuberculin skin test or a biopsy of the vertebrae affected.  If on taking TB medications, the pain or numbness do not begin to resolve with in 2-3 months then it is most probably not TB spine. Yes it is true that TB spine is nontransmissible unless there is direct exposure to the infected tissue without proper gear. You should first consult with a spine specialist and get the diagnosis confirmed before going ahead with taking medications. Radiological confirmation is not the gold standard.

        "instruction": "My platelet count is 80,000 and has decreased from 160,000 in the past year. Hemotologist just wants to monitor every two months. I had a bone barrow test one year ago. No findings although he said he did not get a good sample. Did not want to repeat. Should I be concerned and seek a second opinion.  Recently have had more difficulty with small cuts bleeding more than usual. Thank you.",
        "output": "Hi, This condition of decreased platelets is called thrombocytopenia in medical terms. Decreased platelet count may have several causes such as drug induced , immunological causes, HIV infection etc. From the description that you have given your condition appears to be adult ITP  IMMUNE THROMBOCYTOPENIA . It occurs due to molecules called autoantibodies on the platelets surface which destroys the platelets. Autoantibodies in simple terms is like an army that attacks the people of its own country. I would suggest that you get a peripheral smear evaluated along with your complete blood count by a hematopathologist. You may also get a Coomb is test done to find out if there are other immunological problems that are getting your platelet count down. I presume that your initial work up would have also included HIV testing as HIV can also cause low platelet count. However in your case this does not appear to be the cause. The most important advice I would give is to monitor your platelet count regularly. Repeating the bone marrow test is not necessary for ITP as the problem is not in the marrow. If the platelet count falls below 50, 000 cu.mm then your doctor should be notified. Platelet counts below 20,000 have a risk for causing bleeding within the brain. Adults with platelet counts >50,000mm3 do not require treatment. Treatment is indicated for adults with counts < 50,000mm3 with significant mucous membrane bleeding. Treatment also is indicated for those adults with risk factors for bleeding eg, hypertension, peptic ulcer disease, vigorous lifestyle and in patients with a platelet count < 20,000-30,000mm3. If your platelet count falls to a very critical range your hematologist may treat you with medication such as glucocorticoids, IVIg immunoglobulin or newer drugs. However as your platelet count at the moment is not critical what is usually done is to monitor the platelet count. Because of an increased risk for bleeding aspirin products also should be avoided. Some adult patients with ITP slowly recover over time whereas some have a fall in their platelet count which requires treatment if it is very low. So please continue monitoring your platelet count as before .Best regards."

As his hemoglobin is low, he will need blood transfusion.2. similarly Wepox injections are erythropoietin injections. It stimulates the bone marrow to produce more RBC and hence improved hemoglobins.3. Secondary to HIV, there is reduced immunity and this is possibly causing difficulty in treatment of tuberculosis. The CD4 count is low, indicating poor immunity.4. He will need good nutritional diet to improve immunity. At present, his major problem would be anemia, which will require blood transfusion and Wepox injections.Hope it helps.Any further queries, happy to help again."

A couple of months later I started to suffer from recurrent infections and illnesses. In the last 2 years I have had many infections including Recurrent UTI is, kidney infection, recurrent uvulitis, ear infections, recurrent thrush, lymphadenitis and cellulitis the last 2 requiring hospitalisation. I have also had lots of viruses, colds and flu symptoms. I also suffer from a lot of sores, on my mouth and in my nose, and get lots of mouth ulcers. On a regular basis I suffer from migrainesheadaches, aching limbs, neck, shoulders and backache, numbness in arms and hands, with loss of dexterity in the fingers, fatigue, skipped heart-beats and chest pain, brain fog confusion and memory problems, sometimes slurred speech and occasional blurred vision, occasional low grade fever, and more recently muscle twitching, spasms and cramps. I eat a healthy diet although I am unable to exercise due to chronic pain. I have put on 2 stone in 2 years but this may be due to lack of exercise and my age - 40 years.  I am now about a stone overweight I have also had bouts of depression, usually as a result of being so fed up of it all. I was referred to an Infectious Diseases Specialist about 18 months ago, and initially it was suggested possible CFS. She has run many blood tests to rule out things like thyroid, diabetes and HIV, and I have also had an ECG and cardiac scan. Although my blood tests are usually relatively normal apart from when I am really ill, the one thing that does crop up almost every time is a low white blood cell count. Neutropenia and leukopenia have been noted on several occasions. I recently had another test and all was normal apart from a low absolute leukocyte count normal range 1.5 - 4.......mine was 1.1. As yet I still do not have a diagnosis. Am I right in assuming that the reason I am always getting ill is because of the leukopenia.  Or is the leukopenia a result of always being ill.

        "output": "The Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate ESR is a blood test that measures inflammation or abnormal proteins in the body. While the ESR is not an indication of any one disease, it commonly increases with any condition that causes inflammation, such as infection, arthritis, or cancer. However, up to 10 of normal, healthy people have a mildly elevated ESR and it tends to increase with age. The higher the level of ESR, the more likely the person is to have a condition known to be associated with it .Of the arthritic diseases, an elevated ESR is most closely associated with polymyalgia rheumatica PMR and giant cell arteritis GCA. If disease is active, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, vasculitic disease and almost any other inflammatory condition may be associated with an elevated ESR. Other well-established causes included subacute bacterial endocarditis SBE, myeloma, abscess, pelvic inflammatory disease PID, inflammatory bowel disease IBD and osteomyelitis. However, almost any condition that causes sudden or significant inflammation in the body can be associated with an elevated ESR.An elevated ESR cannot establish any diagnosis by itself. Similarly, a normal ESR does not rule out an arthritic condition since many people with arthritis have a normal or only mildly elevated ESR. A normal ESR does reduce the likelihood of GCA, PMR and SBE. Thus, the ability of this test to predict presence or absence of disease is far from perfect."

The reason for me asking a question is that my blood results just came back and my Gamma G.T is 127 UL which my GP told me is quite high and possibly caused by the medicines I am on.I am currently taking Avanza 60mg, Effexor 150mg, Pariet, Stemetil, Serequel, Panadene Forte throughout each day and now on Targin 105mg. In the past 4 weeks I formed an addiction to Endone 5mg got to the point of taking 30mg daily for a while and when I was getting off that, I started taking Targin 2010 and then 157.5 but now on 105. For a recent few months I was also taking Hypnodorm Fluintrapazem 1mg and Naproxen - now off those both.My alcohol intake is on average 1 standard drink a week, IF THAT - rarely drink for the last 9months. The blood screening also covered Serum Chemistry and my Sodium, Creatine, Protein, ALT, LD, Calcium etc all came back as normal levels. HIV 12 negative and Hep A, B and C all negative. Cholesterol is 5.7mmolL which is the only other somewhat high amount. I feel nauseous throughout the day so do not consume anything until late at night and during the day I tend to get sick and throw up quite a bit, even if it is only water that was consumed. Cannot seem to shake off the anxiety and nauseous feeling for the last 15 months I also take a daily multivitamin and Krill Oil. Would the medicine I have been and am taking be the cause of my rather high Gamma G.T. .  Considering that all other levels are normal. .  and MAIN two important questions are, Is there anything I could do to lower it. .  And should I be concerned of the high number. .  Thank you in advance Dr",
        "output": "Hi,Your elevated Gamma GT levels are due to your opioid intake, especially morphine Avinza. Opioids cause constriction of bile ducts and spasm of Sphincter of Oddi, which prevents the flow of bile into the duodenum. As a result, bile gets accumulated in the biliary canaliculi of the liver. When the amount of accumulated bile increases, some bile oozes out and damages the liver cells causing elevated Gamma GT. In later stages, when this worsens, other liver enzymes and serum bilirubin also gets elevated.Yes, you need to be concerned about it as it can end up causing jaundice later. You can try to control it by cutting down on your opioid intake, specifically morphine. Also avoid fatty foods which will be difficult to digest for you right now.Hope this helps you. Best wishes."

The choice of the drug, the doses, possibility of resistance of the causative agents to the drugs being prescribed and a state of immune depression in the child. Screening for HIV, diabetes, and other immune depressing conditions could be a good starting. Doing a blood culture and sensitivity test, coupled with a proper clinical review to identify an infection focus is my opinion. Thanks and hope this helps as I wish you the best of health.

But the time of developing hypersensitivity is related usually to a psychological conflict you had at the time of onset of the problem. If you started getting it 4 years back, exactly before that you must have had some shocking conflict which remain unresolved. But your brain associated the urticarea to the external environments like heat of sun, dust etc. instead of associating with the conflict. Now your brain has made a programme associated with these factors and whenever you get exposed to such environments you get the symptoms of urticarea . First of all if you can recollect the conflict, then you can resolve it at the mental level. How you reacted to that is important because that is your genetic, constitutional individuality that made you to react in that manner. This will help the Homoeopathic physician to select the constitutional remedy for you. Therefore my advice to you is to approach an expert Homoeopath at the earliest. You should stop taking any anti- drugs because the purpose of the Homoeopathic treatment is not to suppress the skin reaction but is to cure you. Once you are cured, then your urticarea will go away. With best wishes,Dr. C. J. VargheseHomoeopath,"

        "output": "Hello and welcome to HealthApp,Permanent tattoos involve injecting certain dyes in the skin with a needle.G-6-PD deficiency causes degradation and precipitation of hemoglobin in RBCs under conditions of oxidative stress.Oxidative stress is caused by number of conditions like certain drugs.You must be well versed that you have to avoid certain drugs, the list of which must have been given to you by your doctor.The composition of the fluids  dyes used for injecting are not known.They may contain certain agents which cause oxidative stress and thus degradation and precipitation of hemoglobin in the RBCs.There is a risk of transmitting certain diseases like HBV, HIV, etc if unsterile needles are used.So, one needs to be vigilant that the needle used are unused and sterile.Thanks and take careDr Shailja P Wahal"

HIV, Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, CMV are the common viruses transmitted by blood route.Shingles is caused by varicella zoster infection.This virus is not transmitted by blood route.Shingles is caused by reactivation of dormant virus in the nerve ganglia.

Reports for HIV and HCV are non reactive. However, Antibodies test results have not come yet.Please suggest or atleast help me out with your opinion, as to what disease the doctor is actually suspecting and do we need to really worry or not. Thanks a ton for your help...",
        "output": "Hello friend,Thank you for choosing Healthapp . I am a Homoeopath and so will be answering your question in the view point of Homoeopathy. The lab investigations of your blood give value of platelets as below normal. Any biochemical change occurring in your body is not the disease. It is the result of disease or the self defence mechanisms body takes up to keep you healthy. By administering chemical drugs we should not try to bring about changes in the blood picture also.Here you have not mentioned what made you to do a routine blood study. What symptoms were there that prompted you to do so.  Or since how long you are suffering from that particular symptom.  Then you will give a particular event in your life that made you sick. It can be one psychological conflict that made you sick in the organ level. It can also be like this that you had a comparatively innocent symptom in a less serious organ and that was treated by suppressive chemical drugs and thus affected the contents of the blood. It can either be an affection in the ectodermal layer which constitutes skin or an affection in the endodermal layer which constitute mucus membranes of Upper Respiratory tract , Gastro intestinal tract or Urogenital tract. The changes in the blood content is an affection more severe than the other two layers because the blood is a connective tissue developing from mesoderm. This usually happens in the treatment of simple fevers by suppressive chemical drugs. Conventional medicine has no understanding about this hierarchy of different organs or systems and so not agreeing with suppression. As a Homoeopath, I have to suspect such things also as causative factors.A detailed case taking will reveal the course of the disease and will give light to the exciting cause. The fundamental causes are MIASMS, which is the genetic understanding of disease production according to Homoeopathy.Therefore my advise is to consult an expert Homoeopath at the earliest. There is no mistake in doing all possible investigations to make the disease diagnosis. But do not take any medication only to bring back your altered blood picture. There should be radical correction of your constitution which Homoeopathy can do for you. Homoeopathy is the best holistic medicine which takes into consideration your body and mind at the same time.My best wishes for a speedy recovery through Homoeopathy.Dr. C. J. VargheseHomoeopathdrcjvarghese@gmail.com"

Last time the doctor tested his blood for platelet count and was found 175.000 and admiited him in the hospital. Treated him with anitbiotics, the count decreased to 150,000 the next day but brought back to 250, 000 after a few days and was released from the hospital and stopped medicines. He again got fever, shivering and tested for platelet and it is 150 000 now. He is otherwise in general good health or his age and active. what could be the underlying cause.",
        "output": "Dear Ms Jacob It is essential to understand that we need to treat the symptoms and identify the cause. Your concern for the fever is very understandable, but it is important to identify the cause by further tests such as a urine examination. In elderly patients urine infections are very common and can be confirmed only by a urine examination. The variation in the platelet readings is not worrisome and could just be a normal fluctuation or a change primarily due to the infection elsewhere in the body. So for now I would suggest you to get a urine test done and also get a complete blood picture. In cases of infection the white blood cell count or WBC count would be more helpful to guide the treatment. Wish your patient good health."

Is this a a sympton of Wysolene.  Also she feels heaviness in her body,Also are there any food intake that would reduce the tablet effects. Thanks in advance",

However, once the platelet count improves, the dose of corticosteroid is gradually reduced and the possibility of relapse is monitored. Long-term steroids usage is associated with certain side-effects like 1. Increased susceptibility to infections 2. Abnormal fat distribution 3. Osteoporosis 4. Diabetes 5. Hypertension 6. Cataract, etc Symptoms aggravate if medication is stopped abruptly. Make sure while discontinuing the medication, its dose should be tapered gradually instead of stopping it abruptly. Food products which strengthen the immune system should be taken like fresh fruits & vegetables, milk, etc. Wishing a good health. Let me know if I need to clarify further. Thanks & take care."

You could be having the headache not as a result of anemia but as a result of another illness. Antimigraine medication will be of use here  acetaminophen, ibuprofen etc to alleviate the headache. For the anemia, the treatmentcure will depend on the cause of it i.e iron deficiency, vitamin b deficiency, folic acid deficiency, hemorrhagebleeding, renal failure, septicemia, cardiac diseases, HIV infection, liver diseases etc. Your doctor needs to identify the cause of the anemia and treatcure, then you will stop shorting blood anemic and with the associated supplementation of iron pills or blood transfusion depending on the degree of anemia, you will recover fast enough.

This started some months ago, and was only felt when my bare skin was resting on my desk or table. Now the sensation is more frequent and more intensified. Pressure of any kind or from clothing touching my forearm will aggravate the sensation. Any ideas.",
        "output": "Hello Welcome to HealthApp Irritation in forearm may occur either due to- 1. Brachioradial Pruritus Brachioradial pruritus can make you feel itchy, tingling or stinging or a changed sensation on the skin of either or both armsor forearm. Brachioradial pruritus develops due to damage to nerves in the cervical spine neck. This may be caused by a Cervical spine tumors b Cervical rib c Compression of the nerves d Cervical vertebral osteoarthritis e Other spinal cord conditions. Continuous pressure on the spinal neurons conveying itch impulses can activate sensitization processes. When nerves transmitting light touch and pinprick sensations are over-stimulated, the patient may develop sensitive or sore skin, with intense responses to touch and pain conditions known respectively as hyperesthesia and hyperalgesia. Brachioradial pruritus will typically affect one particular area of the skin a dermatome, but may spread to other regions. The condition is more common in sunnier climates, as prolonged exposure to sunlight may harm nerve fibers in the skin. Brachioradial pruritus is usually diagnosed by taking a biopsy of a small piece of skin. This is then examined under a microscope, and doctors may see reduced skin tissue skin atrophy and damaged nerves. 2. Other Causes a Eczema- is a long-term non-infectious condition resulting in itchy inflamed skin, which gets worse at night. Eczema can develop anywhere, but is most frequent behind the knees and on the arms. It appears as red, dry and cracked patches, and you may see fluid-filled bumps on the skin. b Lichen planus -is a chronic non-infectious inflammatory skin ailment. Patients usually get itchy forearms and inner wrists. There may be groups of lesions that are purple-colored, flat, have defined borders, and are covered with white lines, known as Wickham striae. The skin may look shiny and become scaly. c Contact dermatitis- is a common skin condition caused by contact with irritants or allergens. It appears as an itchy rash, and you may also experience blisters, red bumps, thick scaly skin, and soreness in the affected region. d Ringworm infection- appears as a circular itchy rash that is inflamed and reddened at the borders and normal skin-colored in the center. The rash is usually raised, and you may experience sores and blisters. Ringworm infection is very contagious. Hives is a common non-infectious condition with a welt-like rash, which may be extensive. The rash is red or pink, with raised itchy spots, and can last anything from a day up to 6 weeks. The itching can be intense, and occasionally patients experience burning or stinging. e Certain drugs -may cause some people to develop itchy skin rashes, either as an allergic reaction to or as a side effect of the medicine. f You may also notice red spots propagating all over the body, scaly or thick skin, and shortness of breath. Shingles affects previous sufferers of chickenpox, caused by the herpes zoster virus. When the virus becomes reactivated, patients feel tingling, pain and numbness. Above all may be the possible causes of irritation in forearm but exact causes can be diagnosed with proper investigation. Take care"

        "output": "dear patient thank you for your question. Let me just start off my saying that without a hands on examination of your lump it is next to impossible to tell you what exactly it might be.However i will try my best to point you in the right direction.Lipoma The most common cause of solid lump it is quite possible that is a lipoma which has now become a liposarcoma and thus is red painful and expanding. A biopsy would confirm soCyst A solid cyst filled with cheesy sebaceous material may have become infectedSwollen lymph node Swollen lymph nodes are often caused by something as simple as a cold or the flu. In rare cases, the cause is something more serious, such as HIV or cancer.Malignant tumor It is possible that the lump under your skin is a cancerous tumor. Fortunately, the chances of this being the case are quite slim for most individuals, especially considering all the other possible causes of this condition.After having explained all the possibilities i feel it is either an infected cyst or a liposarcoma. Hence please have it checked by your GP"

It may start with some brain shivers, dizziness, acute depressions and irritability, as well as heightened senses of akathisia.Treatment is dependent on the severity of the discontinuation reaction and whether or not further antidepressant treatment is warranted. In cases where further antidepressant treatment is required then the only step required is restarting the antidepressant. This is usually the case following patient noncompliance with the drug. If antidepressants are no longer required, treatment depends on symptom severity. Mild reactions may only require reassurance. Moderate cases may require symptom management. If symptoms of discontinuation are severe, or do not respond to symptom management, the antidepressant can be reinstated and then withdrawn more cautiously. In rare but severe cases, hospitalization may be required.Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further."

People infected with HIV develop antibodies against HIV in their bodies as early as 1 week after exposure and as late as 3 months after exposure. As you have got negative HIV test 5 weeks after exposure, I would advise you to repeat the test after 7 more weeks, that is around 3 months after possible exposure. If that test is negative, then 97 chances are that you are HIV negative, which is the best percentage any test can give.If the test comes negative and you still suffer from swollen lymph nodes, easy bruising, headache and muscle ache, then you should go for blood test to determine complete blood count which will point towards what is going wrong, like presence of infection in body, possible allergic reaction, virus infection, platelet problems etc. Based on the test reports, further treatment can be advised.I hope this information helps you.

Now when we see there is a discoloration of skin along with swelling that means there is a problem with circulation too. As well if this area start paining along with change in skin color then its time to do some tests like dopler study and sensory evaluation for your lower limb blood vessels and nerves. And based on that only the treatment can be plan. I suggest to go ahead and Dont be scare of doing any test or with test report. Because if there is some thing happening wrong you need to know what it is and take treatment in early stage so you can cure it fast and come out of it early.Since you are diabetic with different joint arthritis as per your explanation, I also think so that there is a problem with nerves and blood vessels supplying to lower limb. How ever the conformation can be done only with physical evaluation and test report. I can only suggest to do some stretching exercise for legs to improve circulation and take the treatment properly.Think positive live healthy take appropriate rest and balance diet as per your medical health. And once you start recovering do regular exercises like stretches, walking or cycling etc.Take care."

I will try to answer your question to the best of my ability.Night sweats are not rare In one study published in Annals of Family Medicine, about a third of primary care patients reported night sweats during the past month. Several factors increase the likelihood of night sweats, including panic attacks, sleep problems, fever, numbness in hands and feet, anxiety and stress, and trouble breathing at night.Night sweats may also be a side effect of medication, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors SSRIs, commonly prescribed for depression.Very rarely night sweats could indicate a serious problem. They can be a symptom of autoimmune diseases, heart problems, endocrine disorders, gastroesophageal reflux disease, HIV, tuberculosis, certain cancers, sleep apnea, and panic disorders.I suggest monitoring your body temperature twice a day for a week to detect any fevers, and keeping a record of other symptoms to bring to your doc. Usually, night sweats are not the only symptom when something is wrong.I hope this information is useful for you.

In addition to medication, the following suggestion may help to reduce pain--1. Ice fomentation- If the pain is not severe, try cold packs or cold compresses on the joint to lessen the inflammation and help the pain. Ice the joint for 20 to 30 minutes several times a day.2. Rest the joint.-. Raise the joint if you can on a pillow or other soft object.3. Plenty of water -A lack of water in your body can makes your uric acid levels raise even higher than they already are. Drinking water will help your body stabilize uric acid to a normal level.4 Dietary advice- The Purines, which are chemicals found in some food, when they are taken in food are broken down into uric acid. A diet rich in purines can raise uric acid levels in the body, Meat and seafood may increase your risk of gout. Dairy products may lower your risk.I do hope that you have found something helpful and I will be glad to answer any further query.Take care"

        "output": "Your seizure disorder, non-epileptic or epileptic can be very well managed by a neurologist or an epileptologist which is a neurologist who specializes in epilepsy.

If you have documented ENCEPHALITIS how did you come by the DEFINITE diagnosis of NON-EPILEPTIC event disorder.  Encephalitis is a very strong risk factor for epileptic discharges to develop AND it is not uncommon for people diagnosed with NON-epileptic disorders to have a mixed picture meaning that both epileptic and non-epileptic events can occur at different times.

Arterial Hypotension , psychological stress, labyrinth problems , migraine are excluded in this case by your history. A neurological examination should be done first. I would recommend a treatment with Betahistine twice daily. If your symptoms persist a brain CT scan should be done to exclude a pathological process in the cerebello-pontine angle.

I m 39 years old. last couple of years I feel very shivering while I face a croud. hands through out the body starts shievering, that I met the neufologist and she prescribed betacap 20. can I know about this.  does betacap increases weight or makes dryness in mouth.  can it control bp.  thanks in advance",
        "output": "I read your question and I understand your concern.From your description the neurologist must have considered your episodes as related to anxiety, a panic disorder. They are not due to your epilepsy treatment on the other hand in epileptic patients anxiety or mood disorders are found more often than in the general population.Regarding your questions on Betacap, it is a drug which causes neither weight gain nor mouth dryness, do not fear about that, usually those effects are linked with anti-depressants. It is a drug belonging to the beta blockers class and apart from being used for panic disorder like in your case it is also used to treat high blood pressure, so if that is an issue as well it should help.I hope to have been of help."

The nature and severity of the stroke has to be ascertained with CT scan and treatment planned accordingly. Some cases improve with medicines whereas some need surgery. But whatever the case, recovery period for these patients is usually long. Systemic conditions like BP have to be controlled with medicines. Paralysis and speech take a long time to recover and require physiotherapy and speech therapy. So you have to be patient and remain positive.Hope this is helpful"

        "instruction": "I had brain surgery for Epilepsy in 2005. They removed a section of the right temporal lobe, the hippocampus, and amygdala. I have been on anti-depressant is and anti-anxiety meds since. After many anti-depressants did not help, I was put on Amitriptyline. I take Diazepam for anxiety. With my depression, I had severe insomnia. My Psychiatrist slowly increased Amitriptyline dose and tried adding several meds with it to help sleep and depression. I cannot take Ambien or Lunesta. She tried Trazidone, Ritalin, & when they did not help, she raised my Amitriptyline all the way up to 200 mg. So I was at 200 mg Amitriptyline and 20 mg of Diazepam at night. I started having uncontrollable muscle spasms when I sat or tried to lay down. She added 3 mg Requip, & then had to up it to 6 mg at bedtime. After concerns over the high dose of Amitriptyline, she lowered it to 150 mg at night and added 10 mg of Celexa. About a week after being put on medicine, I started having problems. Raised BP, cold & shivering, etc. My Psych would not return a call for 3 days in a row, so my pharmacist sent me to the ER where I was diagnosed with drug toxicity. The ER dr had me stop Celexa for 3 days, and then take it every other night until my neurologist could see me. I had to cancel first appt. with my neurologist because I was too sick to drive. I have lowered my Amitriptyline to 100 mg and take the 10 mg of Celexa everyday now, & 20 mg of Diazepam at night. I stopped the Requip. For several weeks I have had problems with dizziness & falling, especially if I bend over and stand up, or kneel down & stand up. It does not matter how slow I move. If I take the meds, I sleep anywhere from 3 to 5 hrs a night. skipped meds one night so I could try taking them in the day. I slept for 15 hours. Tried this a few times, same results. I had an incident over the summer, before Amitriptyline was raised so high and before Celexa and Requip, where I went to bed early one night, woke up 13 hours later, could not remember any of the 250 pages I read in a book I had already started, and felt off balance and sick. I went to ER, x-ray & CT scan were clean. I saw my neurologist, he did an MRI and EEG. Both were normal. After being put on Requip, I went back to him. The tremors that I only had on my right side were now on the left. My balance was off, which is was not after MRI and EEG. I do see my neurologist Wed., Feb. 5, 2014. What do I need to ask him to do.  Sleep study.  My pharmacist does not think it is the meds. My sleep is completely off. I am depressed, with suicidal thoughts I had suicide attempt in 2006, and I tremor and have balance issues that make me fall or grab on to something all through the day. Help.",

        "output": "Hi,Welcome to HealthApp,It is good that you ask this question. Recent elevation in SGPT may suggests that either you had re exposure to Hepatitis C virus, or other viral infection like hepatitis A, Hepatitis B or HIV etc , or other agents, like Alcohol or medicines has affected your liver cells. I think your GP is waiting for assessment by hepatologist to do either biopsy or Scan to rule out fibrosis and other signs, which will indicate the need for antiviral medication. it is not life threatening, but surely you need to be assessed for justification of treatment, and proper management without unnecessary delay. Meanwhile i would suggest that if you are not vaccinated against hepatitis A and hepatitis B virus, get immunized. If you are having any high risk factors, like smoking, Alcohol, Drugs etc, avoid it. Do not take any medications without asking your Doctor. You are a carrier for others also, so avoid sharing objects of personal use with others. It may transmit to your spouse also , so use protection. I would suggest that, once again you try to consult your Doctor, and clear any questions and worry, you have.

I am waiting for an MRI to investigate further. I feel that there may be a tumour on the left side as there are several spots that are tender to touch. Any thoughts.",
        "output": "HIThanks for askin to Healthapp really understand your problem, the way you are thinking or having ideas about your pain and problems is just because of your anxiety, otherwise you just forget about the tumor, blurry vision could be due to many reasons, if you are taking any medicine then this could be a reason if you are not eating well or fasting then this could be reason terrible stress condition may also one of the cause, think positively, and do not worry have nice day."

        "instruction": "I had my gallbladder out four months ago. I am only 31 yrs old. I have had diarrhea since. I am now being treated for it with Colestid. I have now been in pain for two months which started as a squeezing type feeling in my chest. Right shoulder blade pain deep inside around trigger point, spinal pain deep, neck pain sharp like nerves and strained musclespings. Pain occasionally wraps around my right ribs and around incisions. Pain in upper back is terrible. Doctors are not listening since I had an MRI which which reveled a reverse Lordis curve and a bulge at c5 c6, also some minor bone spurs in Thoracic. I have been to many doctors, Neuro who said to take Gabapitin, which I do an night, physical therapy , Ortho doctor who said that the MRI in writing was not accurate to what he saw when I brought him the images. Acupuncturist who is also a former gallbladder and liver surgeon thinks that the doctors need to listen to me because he thinks something is wrong that no one is looking at. I am in chronic pain and I get light headed and feel like I m being crushed and strangled literally, I don t know any other way to describe it, it feels like I m not getting enough blood in my head, it is very prominent and makes me feel like I m going to pass out. Had heart checked at ER said it was fine, Thyroid normal, barium swallow normal, stool sample was normal after treating C-diff infection following surgery w Flagyl. It is so bad now to start and getting worse. I feel like my back is breaking, my neck and ribs are in the wrong place, and now my lower back is hurting and shooting pain goes into my right leg and right arm. I have to say that I was besides the gallbladder issue normal before, five months ago. I am not being taken seriously because they cannot find anything wrong in my blood with the exception of a Vitamin D- low- which may be because of the diarrhea or the Colestid, or both and the MRI. I have been labeled depressed as of yesterday which is a big-cop out I feel. I am not depressed for any other reason that I am in pain each day, 247. I have my head together, I am a hard working student, and an overall happy person, but am concerned greatly that I have something very wrong and I have not been treated well. I am very sick in pain now and I need someone to help me that will listen, that is all I ask. I have only had an x-ray done of the top of my right shoulder even though I said the pain was near my shoulder blade. My lungs were fine last time they checked with chest x ray. I had two CT scans since surgery both gave me hives on face, no stones were found. Appetite fine just lots of sever pain. Almost like my back is broken right at the spine. Have an ovarian cyst that is 3.4 cm. On birth control for the last three years. Really, I m in enough agony right now to go to the ER, but that has yielded no answers and either.

        "output": "hello,most of the symptoms you mentioned can be caused because of a herniatic disc at C5-C6 level.A herniatic disc is not a disc to it is right position but it comes out to press the nerv that comes from C5-C6 level.C5 - C6 C6 nerve root - Can cause weakness in the biceps muscles in the front of the upper arms and wrist extensor muscles. Numbness and tingling along with pain can radiate to the thumb side of the hand. This is one of the most common levels for a cervical disc herniation to occur.What doctors do in such cases is giving medicines against the pain, starting from paracetamol to codeine.This is not a final solution for such a problem cause the hernia is always there. A final solution if your pain can not be controlled is the final remove of the herniatic hisc, a little surgery. you should check out this with a neuro surgerist"

On the 6th of April a CT scan of my facehead revealed an incidental finding of a 1.5 cm lesion in the cerebullar part of my brain. suspected it to be an arachnoid cyst. that wasnt the first CT scan I have ever had sinus troubles as a kid yet this was the first anyone ever told me about a cyst being in my brain Was sent for an MRI. And well now The differential diagnosis is post inflammatory cyst or a low grade cystic glioma its in the left posterior medial cerebellum and definitely might explain all my recent headaches. Currently, thats all the information I have about it. I Dont know how fast its growing, dont know why it is there, dont know if its going to turn out to be malignant, do not even know what they are going to do or if they can do anything. This coming friday I have got an appointment with the neurologist who I was told will be then sending me off over to a neuro surgeon which is where I am assuming all those awnsers await me. Please I have attached my MRI report the image cd and some screen shots of it which can be found here.  please tell me what is going on in my head. I can not wait till Friday. Thank you so much",
        "output": "Hi, Thank you for posting your query. Based on the information you have provided, the most likely cause for the lesion in the cerebellum would be a post-inflammatory or post-infective lesion. An arachnoid cyst is normally present from birth, so, if it was not seen in your earlier scans, it is unlikely to be an arachnoid cyst. Similarly for glioma or a cancer to be cystic is quite rare. I would think you should wait and watch and repeat an MRI after 6-8 weeks to see the resolution or progression of the lesion, to decide about any surgery.

I had not eaten so I ordered for some food then that seemed settled. However 3 hours down the line I was not feeling dizzy but rather as if people were far. I could hear people talking, they are near me, but I could hear as if they were far away. We dropped business for the evening and went to hospital Aga Khan, Mombasa. Tests on Malaria , pressure yielded nothing. But the feeling never went. It was a strange feeling like losing balance, it was originating may be from the stomach, my neck was also a bit painful, I would feel my hand moving involuntarily occasionally. When I went finally to see a doctor after going through extra malaria drugs, I was given Stugeron to control the imbalance and something for the neck pain ...cartilaginous stuff prescribed by an orthopaedist. 6 months down the line there was still no change. I would now find it difficult to attend meetings as my head would be full, I would not talk for long as I developed anger feelings etc. I was a strong theatre person, play director and master of ceremonies so everyone started getting worried. My physician sent me for an EEG that brain thing and the EEG was indicative of a generalized epileptiform discharge. I was not comfortable in a crowded place, a noisy place etc. Do not forget my weight was also over board so Type II was at the corner. My stomach still remained a problem and the physician concluded that it could be gastro intestinal epilepsy but could not confirm. He none the less put me on epilim . I went to see a neuro-surgeon in March 2007 in Aga Khan University hospital in Nairobi to seek a second opinion. He performed a brain scan using NMR or MRI.  That noisy tube. I had to be there under mild anaesthesia because I could not lie still due to that imbalance. And he ordered for all tests under the moon on my blood and body organs. HIV was negative but he said diabetes was positive though my sugar levels were 6 to 7. His optician gave me specs. I went to Aga Khan seeing normally. Liver, spleen heart, ear etc were ok. All tests in the brain were negative. He performed an EEG but I never saw the results. He discontinued Epilim. Then he brought a dietician who insisted I lose weight. She proposed a diet for a 10 year old and prescribed 1000 mg glucophage 500 in the morning and 500 in the evening. My stomach problem which was a source of my imbalance was still there. We have come to realize it was acidity. But again it is NOT This treatment for 3 months kept my sugar at starvation levels of 4 to 6. The lab technician who was measuring my sugar once in Mombasa refused to buy the diabetes story and insisted that if it is true then for such levels, a diet control and not medication is enough. One evening after seeing my blood sugar at 4.7 he called and told me not to take the medicine. Infact he insisted that this diet plus the medicine will interfere with my internal body organs as they were not necessary. I e\u2013mailed my sugar levels to my first physician who is a diabetes expert. He asked me to see him urgently the following day and wondered why I had not collapsed. I explained to him what happened in Aga Khan NRB etc. He pulled me out of glucophage. Then after 2 weeks, my stomach just started feeling empty as if it was hollow. The imbalance due to stomach hollowness and was unbearable. I was back on a 500mg tablet of gluophage. He pulled me out of the diet as well. He performed a glucose tolerance test and realized my sugar was low and needed to be brought up. He put me on glucobay whose side effects is gas. Sugar went up as fasting was now 5.8 to 6.4 but post prandial 2 hr after dinner would be 9 to 11. Now 2 things happened Gas became a problem and the imbalance was not going away. I went back to the neurosurgeon who sent me to a gastroenterologist since the brain according to his tests, some sent as far as Germany was OK. The gastroenterologist advised substitution of glucobay to reduce gas.. I went back to glucophage. He gave me Mebiz and Senokot for the stomach. I was still uncomfortable. I was working from home. In 2008 August, I made my first trip to Nairobi on official duty. We used our office car. I reached but that effect of not being comfortable in a crowd was there. Remember I am off Epilim still. We are dealing with mild diabetes. One week after returning to Mombasa, the feeling of that strange imbalance and hyper acidity in the stomach and gas returned. Oily diet in Nairobi probably. I went to my physician. He referred me for another EEG. It was still indicative of generalized epileptiform discharge We were wrong to stop epilim but the MRI or NMR never showed. The physician said EEG deals with reactions, MRI is just photosWith that he gave Epilim Chrono which Iwas still on till 2010-. I went to work the following day and have been there since. I went to the gastroenterologist to sort out this acidity and gas problem. He thought of Irritable bowel syndrome. He did a colonscopy, saw a polyp in the colon that was benign. My physician said IBS symptoms are far from what I have. He feels had we been on Epilim all that time, we could be far since such treatments take 3 years My gastroenterologist has sent me to another neurologist for another EEG to be sure. I have not gone. I am tired. The problem I have now is the slight imbalance, being unable to talk much and that gas here and there but I am improving. Now you see why I cannot use a mobile phone for long. The condition according to my physician is \u201cComplex partial seizure\u201d expressed in the gut and My gastroenterologist thinks it is Irritable bowel syndrome. I am not on a diet but only avoid sugar, oil, salt. Was advised to use vegetable salad as fillers. Recently April 2009 I was in Bondo for a retreat for 4 days. We came by air. So I avoid places. I had never been admitted before, was never on medication etc. Have you given up.  No my last neurosurgeon also ruled out epilepsy. He put me on Olanzapin because anytime now I would hear music from radio, laptop etc I would feel my head getting very full and very uncomfortable. This is worse for music from a laptop or computer till now. When I wear a trouser that fits a bit tightly, my head gets full. Nothing should touch the stomach. I was given neuro-forte and got a relief. But the problem is back. WHAT WAS NEURO-FORTE RELIEVING.  THAT IS THE PROBLEM. I have now come for a conference in India with the same problem.",
        "output": "Hello, Thanks for such a detailed and elaborate question. You have mentioned almost all of the details very nicely. Your physician was right in saying that the MRI donot show a seizure discharges and its only the EEG which shows seizure discharges. If EEG is showing it, there is no doubt why you should not be on anti epileptic. Valproate and levetiracetam are two good anti epileptics and you should try them if not recovering. If symptoms do not improve with them, only then some antipsychotics may help you. Now that you are in India, we would advice you to take a neurologist consultation in India with all your old records. What you have not mentioned in your account is what medications are you currently on. In case if you are not on any medication, do start the anti-epileptic as soon as possible. Hope I am able to solve your concerns."

The physician will rule out many conditions which cause weight loss in a person who is not trying weight management intentionally. Common conditions being diabetes, hyperthyrodism, HIV infection leading to AIDS, TB, hypocortisolism, chronic diarrhea which deprives the body of nutrition from the eaten food etc. Certainly your family history of TBM will help them take decision by having look at you whether you also need to be tested for any kind of TB as it is also one of the causes for weight loss. Heshe will also see if the discharge is treated appropriately or not. So see the doctor and ask what all investigations are necessary. Wish you all the best."

It means that surgery could be curable if whole right liver lobe is resected and then chemotherapy should performed for 8 cycles with FOLFIRI protocol. There is no dount that this is malignant tumor so biopsy should not be done orior to surgery. Only question is if he is in good general condition to go through this extensive procedure.Hope this answers your question.

My toungue develops white coating everyday with some red spots for which I had shown to a skin specialist who had given me Mucopain gel, Tantum oral rinse and Ginicast oral paste which i had applied but did not get any relief, is it because i had mouth contact with prostitute who was having pan masala and should get tested for oral cancer, could you please tell me who are the good oral cancer doctors in Pune and what are the tests to be done for oral cancer. I am attaching my photos of the tounge, kindly suggest. As i have read about Hiv in articles it is said that the symptoms may develop in 2 or 3 years depending on the immunity of the body, so do i have symptoms which are the signs of the disease but may take time to come out in the Elisa Hiv test reports. I get lot of sweating in the legs and in hands, since some time I remain in confused state of mind and forget things. Is it possible to get an Hiv test done through the saliva or from the toungue, kindly suggest some tests. I would like to take appointment from you if possible to explain and show my reports.",
        "output": "Hello,I can understand your concern. I have a few question for you that can help you in deciding if the lesion can be cancerous or not. Firstly, can you scrape the white lesion off the tongue leaving red areas beneath.  If you can scrape it, then it is either tongue coating due to plaque or fungal infection called candidiasis. If you are not able to scrape off the white part of the lesion, then it can be pre-cancerous condition called Leukoplakia. The test to confirm if you have oral cancer is biopsy of the white lesion of the tongue. It can be done by an oral surgeon. To answer your other question, the blood test that identifies HIV antibodies is the best test to confirm presence of HIV infection in your body. It is more sensitive and reliable than saliva or other tests. The test can be done in a week after suspected infection of the virus. If it comes out negative, then it has to repeated after 3 months as HIV antibodies can reach detectable level in blood as late as 86 days after infection. If that test comes negative, then there are 97 chances that you are not having HIV infection. In case of negative tests for oral cancer and HIV infection, you should contact a physician for investigations regarding general physical health of you. I am afraid we cannot provide you with any reference of a doctor in your area. You can ask your family physician to refer you to one. I hope this information helps you. Thank you for choosing HealthApp. Let me know if you have folow up questions.Best,Dr. Viraj Shah"

The extreme cold feeling and hot and sweaty at times can be from thyroid imbalance. This is to be evaluated after doing thyroid function test and then knowing any abnormal values.Calcium is a natural ion required in our food and women over 50 years need more calcium because there is a tendency to develop osteoporosis after menopause. Therefore taking calcium is beneficial for you and in the recommended dose it will keep you in good health.Vitamin B in many types is required for functioning of cells and nerves. This is a water soluble vitamin and essential micro nutrient. Please take plenty of fruits and vegetables which are natural sources of vitamin B. You can take supplement which is available.

These medicines are given because they are life saving and benefit of taking is higher than risk of side effects. These medicines can get cytotoxic to the nervous system. This way it can affect the movements of lips and head causing shivering. There is neurotoxicity to brain including cerebellum which controls head movement. There is release of primitive reflexes as the inhibition on unwanted movements is affected. In this way the lips and shivering movements happen.The lip and shivering movement is a benign condition and does not require treatment.

        "instruction": "Hello, My aunt is nearly 56 years of age, suffering from fourth stage breast cancer . She was initially diagnosed on May 2010 but failed to get treatment at time. She did however visit a doctor in June 2011 and her surgeon advised to reduce the size of the tumor before she could be operated on. Her treatment started in June last year 2011 with 8 courses of AC. Regular checks were done but somehow the chemo did not have an affect. Her hormone receptor tests are negative by the way so the only likely treatment could have been chemo, radiation and surgery. Her oncologist then got her on 5FU which did not have any effect on the tumor as well. Now she has secondary liver cancer as well which has taken over two of the sections of her liver. Her chemo stopped a couple of months ago as she did not want to go through any more of it. She was on pain killers and trying out Reiki treatment to manage day to day aches. She would complain of stomach pains and sometimes had trouble passing stool. Then a few days ago her health deteriorated when she started shivering and was admitted in the hospital. The doctors explained that her sodium levels had gone down. Now over the last few days she has been suffering from what looks like ascites stomach really blown up and hand and feet hard as wood but the doctors are not draining her stomach of the fluids. She cries due to the severe stomach aches and her urine has turned almost black. Her eyes are yolky yellow and she is on constant pain killers and catheter for her urine. Her breast cancer is reeking blood and needs regular changing. Today they informed us that her platelet count has gone down to 28,000 but still havent informed us whether we should arrange for a blood transfusion. The hospital she is in is not a cancer hospital as this was the one closest at the time when she fell ill. I personally feel the doctors are not taking this case as an oncologist would as a- they have failed to address the ascites issue b- are treating her like a normal patient even when they have all her reports in front of them. They inserted a food pipe today as well so that they can give her food via that. I just feel that since she has been admitted her health is deteriorating even more. Do you think we should change hospitals. Or is this normal in her case to suffer so much. Concerned niece - El",
        "output": "Before i answer your question, let me inform you that i am an experienced oncologist and have been working at a dedicated cancer hospital for some time now. Let me make a few things clear to you before i move on to the specifics. Maybe you know them already, but nonetheless. Firstly, your aunt cannot be cured of her disease by any form of treatment. Secondly, the treatment that she has undergone so far before this admission seems to be largely correct from an oncological point of view. Finally to your query. Treatment at this point is aimed only to provide her a good quality of life and to prolong whatever life we can. From what i gather she has gross ascites and her liver is failing as well due to the disease. So she would benefit in terms of pain by draining the fluid from her abdomen, although it will re-accumulate quickly and need frequent draining. Also, since her liver is failing and platelets are low, this draining procedure will have to be done after correcting her bleeding profile by transfusing plasma and platelets. In short, she will benefit from shifting to a cancer hospital. However two things you have to consider before shifting are whether she is in a condition to be shifted and your finances."

Usually, rather than fever, what is more, important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day. If the kid is active and playing around when there is no fever, it is probably a viral illness and it does not require antibiotics at all. Once the viral fever comes it will there for 4-7 days. So do not worry about the duration if the kid is active. Paracetamol can be given in the dose of 15mgkgdose maximum ceiling dose of 500mg every 4-6th hourly that too only if fever is more than 100F.

It is quite common for babies of this age group to pass a small amount of diarrhea or loose stools soon after feeds. This need not be treated as diarrhea and especially antibiotics are not indicated. When the baby takes milk, the stomach expands - then when it is contracting it sets off a waveform which moves down the intestines and when that wave reaches the lower down rectum, a small quantity of the stool is evacuated out. This is the basis for gastro-colic reflex. Do not worry.

Teens who have attention deficit or learning disabilities can be forgetful because of deficiencies in ability to ORGANIZE, remember, and complete tasks.

        "output": "Hello. Welcome to Ask A Doctor. I have read your query and here is my advice. A side effect of Motrinibuprofen is to cause stomach inflammation which can make the stomach is inside lining bleed. The blood is carried along with intestinal contents through the entire intestinal tract. By the time it reaches the end it is black and makes stool black. Blueberries, Pepto-Bismol, and iron supplements also make stool black. A hive rash is an allergic rash and could be due to Motrin, especially if the hives appeared very soon after you gave him the dose. Tylenol does not irritate the stomach and is safer. Hard stool is usually due to not enough liquid intake. You may want to try giving apple and pear juices. If that does not help, prune juice, 1-2ounces one-two times per day might be beneficial. Frequent colds and coughing could be from being in close contact with other young children who are infected with various viruses. How old is your child.  Does he attend daycare.  Also, cold and cough syrups are NOT recommended to give to children five years or under because their is no evidence that they are effective for colds and they have side effects. Saline nose dropssuch as Nasal one drop into each nostril before feeding and naptime will moisturize his nasal mucus and help him to sneeze and blow mucus to front of nose where you can easily suction it out. Humidifier so that mist gets to his nose might also help. Hope I have answered your query. If you have any further questions, I will be happy to help. Arnold Zedd, MD, FAAP"

Every since then she has suffered with unexplained rashes that often get treated as hand foot mouth. However, these rashes become infected and eventually turn into impetigo for no explained reason. She often gets hot and flares in what I would describe as exzema but its almost more like hives. Her lymph nodes on the back of her neck have been huge and concerning since she was an infant. At times its also the ones in her neck and under her arms but our pediatrician re assures us this is normal. Lately she has been going cross eyed when trying to focus or shell daze off but she seems to laugh it off after some joking from her older sibling. She has seemed to hit most mile stones on target but we recently had a friend lose their daughter to HLH and some of the things in her past medical history identify a little too well for comfort for me.

The location you describe is a common place to feel them. Normally, people have them all over inside their body. Usually, they are too small to feel. If there is a scratch, burn, or infection then the nearby lymph nodes will react and enlarge and can be felt.You may check her scalp to see if there is any scaling, red areas, or bumps with pus. If so, then that might explain the enlargements you feel. If your baby is otherwise healthy and you cannot feel any others, then probably nothing needs to be done now except to watch. Other parts of the body where lymph nodes are in front of neck, underarms, in the groin creases.If she develops fever, loses weight, or you feel more lymph nodes, then take her to the doctor right away.

This happens when the baby sucks at the breast very fast and in eagerness to drink milk will gulp in the air too. Unless the air comes out like burping or flatus this discomfort will be there and next time check if the baby is sucking too fast and gulping in the air too. You will be more convinced. Usually, I do not advice any medicines for this as they give only temporary relief.The two best ways to relieve this distress is -1. Do not put the baby in lying position after feeding until the baby burps out the swallowed air.2.

        "output": "Hi...Thank you for consulting in Healthapp .By what you quote I put forth these possibilities -1. Congenital airway anomaly - this causes noisy breathing both inspiratory and expiratory noise, actually inspiratory will be more than expiratory noise. But the child will not struggle to breath and there will not be fast breathing and in-drawing of chest wall. The sound will be more heard during sleeping and feeding.2. Wheezing - Here the sound will be predominantly expiratory the kid will be struggling to breathe, might turn blue and require oxygen and may have chest wall in-drawing.But both are associated with recurrent cough and cold. But these might not always be bacterial infections which require antibiotics and usually are predominantly viral and are self-limiting.Hope my answer was helpful for you. I am happy to help any time. Further clarifications and consultations on Healthapp  are welcome. If you do not have any clarifications, you can close the discussion and rate the answer. Wish your kid good health."

        "output": "Hi...Thank you for consulting in Healthapp .Fever of few days without any localizing signs could as well a viral illness. Usually rather than fever, what is more important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day. If the kid is active and playing around when there is no fever, it is probably viral illness and it does not require antibiotics at all. Once viral fever comes it will there for 4-7 days. So do not worry about duration if the kid is active.Paracetamol can be given in the dose of 15mgkgdose maximum ceiling dose of 500mg every 4-6th hourly that too only if fever is more than 100F. I suggest not using combination medicines for fever, especially with Paracetamol."

        "output": "Hello, I just read your query.* See in babies constant fever may have many reasons. You did not mention here that have you ever performed any blood investigation and urine examination. *Because urinary tract infection is one of the most common cause in babies behind fever.* In blood examination you can ask your doctor about Total leucocyte count if it is raised it will indicate about infection in body, CRPit will also indicate acute infection, widal test for typhoid. If you already performed all tests and all are within normal limit.*Then I would advice you to go for an ayurvedic medicine named Giloy  tinospora cordifolia, you can take fresh giloy if it is available nearby you and make juice of its stem and give 5ml of its juice twice a day with water to your baby. If your baby does not find its taste good then you can add sugar or honey in it. If fresh giloy is not available then take dry giloy. Add some giloy in one glass of water and half water remains, then you can give it to your baby in two parts. Giloy is very helpful in curing fever.* Whenever fever is there, do sponging with fresh water. Ice water sometimes cause shivering in baby, so do whole body sponging with fresh water for 5 to 10 minutes as it will also help in lowering fever *Give him fresh fruits and vegetables, juice, soups, liquid and semi solid diet as in fever all these things are easy to digest.* I hope you are satisfied with my answer and find it helpful. Thank you."

Usually rather than fever, what is more important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day. If the kid is active and playing around when there is no fever, it is probably viral illness and it does not require antibiotics at all. Once viral fever comes it will there for 4-7 days. So do not worry about duration if the kid is active.Paracetamol can be given in the dose of 15mgkgdose maximum ceiling dose of 500mg every 4-6th hourly that too only if fever is more than 100F. I suggest not using combination medicines for fever, especially with Paracetamol.Hope my answer was helpful for you. I am happy to help any time.

If its only on the site you mentioned, its hard to comment on without having a look at it. Kindly check if there is any pus collecting in those lesions.

In that case stop bottle and feed only breast milk and other feeds, if you must from cup with spoon . I have seen this working in my clinic and I strongly dissuade bottle feed and would advise a probiotic powder and a racecadotril powder available in sachets like Zedott, Enuff or Racedot.

If there is no relief in 2 to 3 days, bacterial enteritis or amoebiasis can be considered when we will add gastrointestinal antibiotic injectableoral or antiamoebic drugs and there will be mucus and blood in stools.Follow up and take care to prevent dehydration by giving ORS, rice water or sugar and salt solution.

        "output": "A strep throat is a bacterial infection of the throat pharynx, tonsils or both caused by the bacteria group a streptococcus.Unfortunately common usage has deteriorated to mean sore throat in general. This is inaccurate. Many more viruses cause sore throats than streptococcal bacteria. Fever & sore throat for more than 2 days without cold symptoms suggests possible strep. A culture is best diagnostic test.Hives also called urticaria are a common skin reaction in children, characterized by a raised, flat pink rash called wheals. The shape of these bumps can vary, and their size can range from about one-half inch to several inches in diameter. The larger wheals often have pale centers.In most cases, hives are caused by allergies. Foods like shellfish, milk, peanuts, or chocolate can trigger them. So can insect bites or drugs like penicillin. In winter some children develop hives when they are exposed to cold air. Occasionally, children with a strep throat will have hives. I would give an antihistaminic syrup and a lotion to apply to reduce itching. As you are already giving medicines continue and review with your doctor. Take care"

Also , go for IgE and AEC lab tests to help the diagnosis.Antihistamines are the first line of therapy for urticaria.Diphenhydramine 25 mg IV or 50 mg IM or PO or hydroxyzine 50 mg IM or PO should be administered if they are available.If any features of anaphylaxis eg, hypotension, respiratory distress, stridor, gastrointestinal distress, swallowing problems, joint swelling, joint pain are present, immediate medical intervention should occur.Acute urticaria may progress to life-threatening angioedema andor anaphylactic shock in a very short time, although it usually presents as rapid-onset shock with no urticaria or angioedema.If associated angioedema is present, especially if laryngeal angioedema eg, hoarseness, stridor is suspected, prehospital administration of 0.3-0.5 mg of intramuscular [IM] epinephrine may be warranted. If associated bronchospasm is present, prehospital nebulized albuterol may be warranted.Other measures may be appropriate, such as continuous electrocardiography ECG blood pressure and pulse oximetry monitoring administering IV crystalloids if the patient is hypotensive and administering oxygen.

        "output": "Most often cough and cough in children is caused due to certain viral infections. Most often such infections are associated with allergic reactions which can be responsible for runny nose. It may also be associated with increase in temperature and muscle fatigue as in her case. The muscle fatigue is more likely to be the cause of her eye pain as well as her knees hurting. Giving paracetamol should provide relief for both fever and muscle pain. Giving some antiallergic like cetirizine syrup for a few days should help. Also give her steam inhalation. Water in the form of vapor reaches deep into the lungs and helps in diluting the cough and provides relief from dry cough. In case the symptoms last for more than 7 days or if the child grows lethargic or starts wheezing, you would have to take the child to a doctor without delay."

I usually suggest such patients antihistamines like cetirizine or levocetirizine regularly for 7-10 days, depending upon response.2. I would also suggest her to regularly apply lotion like calamine over the itchy areas as well as over dry skin.3. Please do not scratch the itchy areas as scratching would only increase itching and hives. Please make sure that her nails are well trimmed.4. I also suggest my such patients to avoid too tight clothing or irritant clothing material like woolen clothes. Usually loosecomfortable-fitting, cotton clothes are better for patients with hives.5. If physical factors like temperature differences, warm water, hotspicy foodsbeverages, etc are aggravating her hives, I would suggest her to avoid them.6. If she has repeated digestive problems, I would also suggest my such patients a course of anti-parasitic drugs like albendazole or nitazoxanide.7. If she does not respond to above measures, I would suggest to get her investigated with basic investigations like complete blood counts, ESR, CRP, stool & urine examination, serum total IgE, etc. Which might help towards diagnosis.Hope above suggestions will be helpful to your daughter.Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at HealthApp.Wish your daughter the best of the health ahead.Thank you &"

In Hirschsprung disease the nerve development of the bowel is affected causing constipation. Barium xrays and anorectal manometry may be done to confirm it.In hypothyrodism, the blood levels of the thyroid hormone required for good bowel movements is low causing constipation.

        "output": "Hi...I went through the history points you have provided - THIS IS NOT A VIRAL INFECTION.I feel that your baby is having cow is milk protein allergy CMPA. Unusually babies grow out of this sort of allergy by 1 year of age. My suggestions for you - 1. Mother should go off cow is milk protein completely. This means that you should avoid consumption of anything and everything related to cow is milk - like - milk curds ghee butter milk chocolates biscuits ice creams etc. Even while buying commercial food products, you need to see the ingredients and if they contain milk - do not consume them.2. Feed you baby only exclusive breast feeds till 6 months of age and then start rice based feeds. 3. If this is followed scrupulously - the baby will stop having diarrhoea in another 3-4 days and then start gaining weight too.4. If you feel your feeds alone are inadequate for the baby, then Zerolac is the only option. I request you to keep me posted about the recovery of the baby and follow of the case.I wish your kid a speedy recovery. If you need any future medical consultation and suggestions, I will be glad to help. You can approach me at the following link.

A urine check showing sugar means that when the urine was made, the blood sugar was above the renal threshold.

        "output": "Thanks for asking your question at HealthApp. Your son is probably suffering from a condition called bronchiolitis which is caused by a virus and affects children between 6 months to 3 years of age. In most cases it is a self limiting disease but often requires nebulisation. If he is wheezing, duolin needs to be given. But if he is not, rather give him nebulisation with 3 NaCl solution hypertonic saline and it should help. Do not give budecort more than twice a day. I am unable to listen to the chest of the child and needed to evaluate whether there is likelihood of superadded bacterial infection which needs to be treated with antibiotics. Some antiallergic like levocetirizine also might be required. He may also need to be assessed for chronic diseases like tuberculosis. Get in touch with your doctor who would be able to tell you more.The commonest side effect of duolin is increased heart rate. About the side-effects, they are there but you need not worry. You need to get the disease treated first.Hope that helps. Feel free to revert back with further queries if any."

I have been battling an oral infection for quite a few weeks now Four to be exact, and I believed it to be thrush yeast infection. I first went to Planned Parenthood and received fluconazole Diflucan, which I have had before, and a week is worth of metronidazole Flagyl, just in case Bacterial Vaginosis went undetected. The Diflucan I have taken before, but at this particular visit was the only time I have taken Diflucan in two consecutive weeks. The white spots cleared up, following the treatment, as well as using geranium violet, gargling with warm salt water after eating, eating 2 cups of pro-biotic yogurt a day, and taking at least 3 heaping spoonfuls of wet garlic a day and letting it sit in my mouth for a few minutes before swallowing. And, brushing my teeth before using garlic, disinfecting the toothbrush before and after brushings. My diet consisted of hardly any breads, but when I did, toasted wheat bread was consumed. I went to urgent care for a check up and, since I have been trying home remedies and there are no visible signs, I was sent home untreated and without tests done. A few days later and after going to a very smoky rave, I developed a sore throat. I went in and was prescribed Nazonex. It left a stinging sensation in my throat, and decided to take Claritan-D instead. That helped with the the sore throat and nasal congestion, but now I am out of the 5-day medication and concerned if the meds are masking a real issue, or have I not been taking them long enough.  With the Claritan, I have been trying to remember to take acidophilus pills, 500mg, twice daily.My question is, can allergy meds mask an oral infection.  I am concerned that I may have some other bacterial infection. Each time I go to urgent care, they do not take any cultures, they only do a visual inspection. I do not have health insurance and can not afford the 80 visit to urgent care, if they are not going to properly treat me. As a side note, I have been tested for other sexual diseases, and the results are all negative HIV, herpes, syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia. When they looked in my mouth, they just said it looked a little red, and that my nose was draining, and gave me the Nazonex. At the moment, it feels like there is a some sort of small blockage at the base of the throat Adam is apple area and nasal airway, and there are sores on the tip of my tongue and the base of my lower and upper teeth in the same area however, I am not certain if its from the yeast coming back or if I just simply burned my mouth on yesterday is lunch - The bumps look small, round, red, and flat, and are mostly located on the perimeter of the tongue near the front teeth.On the positive side, my vagina stopped itching first time in five months, but I have not so much as kissed my man since the oral outbreak -",

        "output": "Hello,Mouth sores that reoccur are often viral. Stress can bring on an episode and repeat. Have your mouth sores been tested.  Simple swab, biopsy, etc..  See a specialist such as an oral surgeon. Visit a dental school or a dentist with a greater interest in oral pathology. You seem to still need more diagnosis. Systemic conditions are known to be associated with mouth sores such as HIVAids. Testing is critical to determine normal ranges and overall health. Your genetic history and family illness history may offer clues. Are you compromised.  There are auto immune disorders. Students stressed can have Mono. Travel lately.  Unusual exposure or diet change.  Keep asking many questions.A history of Measles can later appear as Shingles. Mouth sores can be included in Shingles. Virus exposure history helps diagnosis.Having an association with another carrier of a virus such as Herpes can cause repeat reactions.Changing routines, limiting exposure and getting rid of items that might carry a virus are all good actions. You seem to have tried many actions. One other consideration is an allergic reaction to your dental care products and make sure you have ruled this out. Try changing toothpaste or rinses. Flavorings and other ingredients are known to cause reactions. Symptomatic treatment with pain medication, rinsing warm salt water, avoid irritants and time passing is the best advice for now. I try to provide questions to help you think and you have the option to visit other doctors for continuing clinical evaluation."

As it is clear that you are on multiple drugs for a number of medical conditions including T2 DM, hypothyroidism and depression. There are 7 drugs listed, which you are taking regularly. Of these drugs Metformin 1000 mg twice a day, is most often very well tolerated drug. Common side effects noticed on beginning of treatment with it are mostly gastrointestinal disturbances. Which invariably stop on taking the drug with or after food. Tremors shivering is unlikely to happen with that drug. Among other drugs duloxetine is more likely to cause symptoms like restlessness, poor coordination and shivering. Even Injections Humira adalimumab is the other drug which causes weakness & dizziness. SOmetimes due to multiple medications it is very difficult to pin point which particular side effect is due to which specific drug. But Metformin is unlikely drug for shivering. As regards feeling of weakness, if both diabetes blood glucose uncontrolled as well as if hypothyroidism is also not well controlled, there can be fairly severe weakness as well as sleepy feeling. Since there is no mention of blood glucose levels and HbA1c as well as TSH levels, it is difficult to know.Thanks"

Kaposi sarcoma is a disease in which malignant tumors cancer can form in the skin mucous membranes lymph nodes and other organs. Kaposi sarcoma is a cancer that causes lesions abnormal tissue to grow in the skin the mucous membranes lining the mouth nose and throat lymph nodes or other organs. The lesions are usually purple and are made of cancer cells new blood vessels red blood cells and white blood cells. Kaposi sarcoma is different from other cancers in that lesions may begin in more than one place in the body at the same time. Human herpesvirus-8 HHV-8 is found in the lesions of all patients with Kaposi sarcoma. This virus is also called Kaposi sarcoma herpesvirus KSHV. Most people infected with HHV-8 do not get Kaposi sarcoma. Those infected with HHV-8 who are most likely to develop Kaposi sarcoma have immune systems weakened by disease or by drugs given after an organ transplant. There are several types of Kaposi sarcoma including - Classic Kaposi sarcoma. - African Kaposi sarcoma. - Immunosuppressive therapyrelated Kaposi sarcoma. - Epidemic Kaposi sarcoma. - Nonepidemic Kaposi sarcoma. Tests that examine the skin lungs and gastrointestinal tract are used to detect find and diagnose Kaposi sarcoma. The following tests and procedures may be used - Physical exam and history  An exam of the body to check general signs of health including checking skin and lymph nodes for signs of disease such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patient is health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken. - Chest x-ray  An x-ray of the organs and bones inside the chest. An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film making a picture of areas inside the body. This is used to find Kaposi sarcoma in the lungs. - Biopsy  The removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a microscope by a pathologist to check for signs of cancer. One of the following types of biopsies may be done to check for Kaposi sarcoma lesions in the skin - Excisional biopsy  A scalpel is used to remove the entire skin growth. - Incisional biopsy  A scalpel is used to remove part of a skin growth. - Core biopsy  A wide needle is used to remove part of a skin growth. - Fine-needle aspiration FNA biopsy  A thin needle is used to remove part of a skin growth. An endoscopy or bronchoscopy may be done to check for Kaposi sarcoma lesions in the gastrointestinal tract or lungs. - Endoscopy for biopsy A procedure to look at organs and tissues inside the body to check for abnormal areas. An endoscope is inserted through an incision cut in the skin or opening in the body such as the mouth. An endoscope is a thin tube-like instrument with a light and a lens for viewing. It may also have a tool to remove tissue or lymph node samples which are checked under a microscope for signs of disease. This is used to find Kaposi sarcoma lesions in the gastrointestinal tract. - Bronchoscopy for biopsy A procedure to look inside the trachea and large airways in the lung for abnormal areas. A bronchoscope is inserted through the nose or mouth into the trachea and lungs. A bronchoscope is a thin tube-like instrument with a light and a lens for viewing. It may also have a tool to remove tissue samples which are checked under a microscope for signs of disease. This is used to find Kaposi sarcoma lesions in the lungs. After Kaposi sarcoma has been diagnosed tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread to other parts of the body. The following tests and procedures may be used to find out if cancer has spread to other parts of the body - Blood chemistry studies  A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body. An unusual higher or lower than normal amount of a substance can be a sign of disease. - CT scan CAT scan A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body such as the lung liver and spleen taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography computerized tomography or computerized axial tomography. - PET scan positron emission tomography scan A procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body. A small amount of radioactive glucose sugar is injected into a vein. The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body. Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do. This imaging test checks for signs of cancer in the lung liver and spleen. - CD34 lymphocyte count A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amount of CD34 cells a type of white blood cell. A lower than normal amount of CD34 cells can be a sign the immune system is not working well. Certain factors affect prognosis chance of recovery and treatment options. The prognosis chance of recovery and treatment options depend on the following - The type of Kaposi sarcoma. - The general health of the patient especially the patient is immune system. - Whether the cancer has just been diagnosed or has recurred come back. Classic Kaposi Sarcoma Key Points - Classic Kaposi sarcoma is found most often in older men of Italian or Eastern European Jewish origin. - Signs of classic Kaposi sarcoma may include slow-growing lesions on the legs and feet. - Another cancer may develop. Classic Kaposi sarcoma is found most often in older men of Italian or Eastern European Jewish origin. Classic Kaposi sarcoma is a rare disease that gets worse slowly over many years. Signs of classic Kaposi sarcoma may include slow-growing lesions on the legs and feet. Patients may have one or more red purple or brown skin lesions on the legs and feet most often on the ankles or soles of the feet. Over time lesions may form in other parts of the body such as the stomach intestines or lymph nodes. The lesions usually do not cause any symptoms but may grow in size and number over a period of 10 years or more. Pressure from the lesions may block the flow of lymph and blood in the legs and cause painful swelling. Lesions in the digestive tract may cause gastrointestinal bleeding. Another cancer may develop. Some patients with classic Kaposi sarcoma may develop another type of cancer before the Kaposi sarcoma lesions appear or later in life. Most often this second cancer is non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Frequent follow-up is needed to watch for these second cancers. Epidemic Kaposi Sarcoma Key Points - Epidemic Kaposi sarcoma is found in patients who have acquired immunodeficiency syndrome AIDS. - Signs of epidemic Kaposi sarcoma can include lesions that form in many parts of the body. - The use of drug therapy called cART reduces the risk of epidemic Kaposi sarcoma in patients infected with HIV. Epidemic Kaposi sarcoma is found in patients who have acquired immunodeficiency syndrome AIDS. Epidemic Kaposi sarcoma occurs in patients who have acquired immunodeficiency syndrome AIDS. AIDS is caused by the human immunodeficiency virus HIV which attacks and weakens the immune system. When the body is immune system is weakened by HIV infections and cancers such as Kaposi sarcoma can develop. Most cases of epidemic Kaposi sarcoma in the United States have been diagnosed in homosexual or bisexual men infected with HIV. Signs of epidemic Kaposi sarcoma can include lesions that form in many parts of the body. The signs of epidemic Kaposi sarcoma can include lesions in different parts of the body including any of the following - Skin. - Lining of the mouth. - Lymph nodes. - Stomach and intestines. - Lungs and lining of the chest. - Liver. - Spleen. Kaposi sarcoma is sometimes found in the lining of the mouth during a regular dental check-up. In most patients with epidemic Kaposi sarcoma the disease will spread to other parts of the body over time. Fever weight loss or diarrhea can occur. In the later stages of epidemic Kaposi sarcoma life-threatening infections are common. The use of drug therapy called cART reduces the risk of epidemic Kaposi sarcoma in patients infected with HIV. Combined antiretroviral therapy cART is a combination of several drugs that block HIV and slow down the development of AIDS and AIDS-related Kaposi sarcoma. For information about AIDS and its treatment see the AIDSinfo website. Tests that examine the skin lungs and gastrointestinal tract are used to detect find and diagnose Kaposi sarcoma.

The cells of each type of sarcoma look different under a microscope. The soft tissue tumors are grouped based on the type of soft tissue cell where they first formed. This summary is about the following types of soft tissue sarcoma Fat tissue tumors - Liposarcoma . This is a rare cancer of the fat cells. Liposarcoma usually forms in the fat layer just under the skin. In children and adolescents liposarcoma is often low grade likely to grow and spread slowly. There are several different types of liposarcoma. Myxoid liposarcoma is usually low grade and responds well to treatment. The cells of myxoid liposarcoma have a certain genetic change called a translocation part of one chromosome switches places with part of another chromosome. In order to diagnose myxoid liposarcoma the tumor cells are checked for this genetic change. Pleomorphic liposarcoma is usually high grade likely to grow and spread quickly and is less likely to respond well to treatment. Bone and cartilage tumors Bone and cartilage tumors are a mix of bone cells and cartilage cells. Bone and cartilage tumors include the following types - Extraskeletal mesenchymal chondrosarcoma . This type of bone and cartilage tumor often affects young adults and occurs in the head and neck. - Extraskeletal osteosarcoma . This type of bone and cartilage tumor is very rare in children and adolescents. It is likely to come back after treatment and may spread to the lungs. Fibrous connective tissue tumors Fibrous connective tissue tumors include the following types - Desmoid-type fibromatosis also called desmoid tumor or aggressive fibromatosis. This fibrous tissue tumor is low grade likely to grow slowly. It may come back in nearby tissues but usually does not spread to distant parts of the body. Rarely the tumor may disappear without treatment. Desmoid tumors sometimes occur in children with changes in the adenomatous polyposis coli APC gene. Changes in this gene cause familial adenomatous polyposis FAP. FAP is an inherited condition in which many polyps growths on mucous membranes form on the inside walls of the colon and rectum. Genetic counseling a discussion with a trained professional about inherited diseases and a possible need for gene testing may be needed. - Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans . This is a rare tumor of the deep layers of the skin found in children and adults. The cells of this tumor have a certain genetic change called a translocation part of one chromosome switches places with part of another chromosome. In order to diagnose dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans the tumor cells are checked for this genetic change. - Fibrosarcoma . There are two types of fibrosarcoma in children and adolescents - Infantile fibrosarcoma also called congenital fibrosarcoma. This type of fibrosarcoma is found in children aged 4 years and younger. It most often occurs in infants and may be seen in a prenatal ultrasound exam. This tumor is often large and fast growing but rarely spreads to distant parts of the body. The cells of this tumor usually have a certain genetic change called a translocation part of one chromosome switches places with part of another chromosome. In order to diagnose infantile fibrosarcoma the tumor cells are checked for this genetic change. - Adult-type fibrosarcoma. This is the same type of fibrosarcoma found in adults. The cells of this tumor do not have the genetic change found in infantile fibrosarcoma. See the PDQ summary on Adult Soft Tissue Sarcoma Treatment for more information. - Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor . This is a fibrous tissue tumor that occurs in children and adolescents. It is likely to come back after treatment but rarely spreads to distant parts of the body. A certain genetic change has been found in about half of these tumors. - Low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma . This is a slow-growing tumor that affects young and middle-aged adults. The cells of this tumor usually have a certain genetic change called a translocation part of one chromosome switches places with part of another chromosome. In order to diagnose low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma the tumor cells are checked for this genetic change. The tumor may come back many years after treatment and spread to the lungs and the lining of the wall of the chest cavity. Lifelong follow-up is needed. - Myxofibrosarcoma . This is a rare fibrous tissue tumor that is found less often in children than in adults. - Sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma . This is a rare fibrous tissue tumor that can come back and spread to other places years after treatment. Long-term follow-up is needed. Skeletal muscle tumors Skeletal muscle is attached to bones and helps the body move. - Rhabdomyosarcoma . Rhabdomyosarcoma is the most common childhood soft tissue sarcoma in children 14 years and younger. See the PDQ summary on Childhood Rhabdomyosarcoma Treatment for more information. Smooth muscle tumors Smooth muscle lines the inside of blood vessels and hollow internal organs such as the stomach intestines bladder and uterus. - Leiomyosarcoma . This smooth muscle tumor has been linked with Epstein-Barr virus in children who also have HIV disease or AIDS. Leiomyosarcoma may also form as a second cancer in survivors of inherited retinoblastoma sometimes many years after the initial treatment for retinoblastoma. So-called fibrohistiocytic tumors - Plexiform fibrohistiocytic tumor . This is a rare tumor that usually affects children and young adults. The tumor usually starts as a painless growth on or just under the skin on the arm hand or wrist. It may rarely spread to nearby lymph nodes or to the lungs. Peripheral nervous system tumors Peripheral nervous system tumors include the following types - Ectomesenchymoma . This is a rare fast-growing tumor of the nerve sheath protective covering of nerves that are not part of the brain or spinal cord that occurs mainly in children. Ectomesenchymomas may form in the head and neck abdomen perineum scrotum arms or legs. - Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor . This is a tumor that forms in the nerve sheath. Some children who have a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor have a rare genetic condition called neurofibromatosis type 1 NF1. This tumor may be low grade or high grade. - Malignant triton tumor . These are very rare fast-growing tumors that occur most often in children with NF1. Pericytic Perivascular Tumors Pericytic tumors form in cells that wrap around blood vessels. Pericytic tumors include the following types - Myopericytoma . Infantile hemangiopericytoma is a type of myopericytoma. Children younger than 1 year at the time of diagnosis may have a better prognosis. In patients older than 1 year infantile hemangiopericytoma is more likely to spread to other parts of the body including the lymph nodes and lungs. - Infantile myofibromatosis . Infantile myofibromatosis is another type of myopericytoma. It is a fibrous tumor that often forms in the first 2 years of life. There may be one nodule under the skin usually in the head and neck area myofibroma or nodules in several skin areas muscle and bone myofibromatosis. These tumors may go away without treatment. Tumors of unknown origin Tumors of unknown origin the place where the tumor first formed is not known include the following types - Alveolar soft part sarcoma . This is a rare tumor of the soft supporting tissue that connects and surrounds the organs and other tissues. It is most commonly found in the limbs but can occur in the tissues of the mouth jaws and face. It may grow slowly and may have spread to other parts of the body at the time of diagnosis. Alveolar soft part sarcoma may have a better prognosis when the tumor is 5 centimeters or smaller or when the tumor is completely removed by surgery. The cells of this tumor usually have a certain genetic change called a translocation part of one chromosome switches places with part of another chromosome. In order to diagnose alveolar soft part sarcoma the tumor cells are checked for this genetic change. - Clear cell sarcoma of soft tissue . This is a slow-growing soft tissue tumor that begins in a tendon tough fibrous cord-like tissue that connects muscle to bone or to another part of the body. Clear cell sarcoma most commonly occurs in deep tissue of the foot heel and ankle. It may spread to nearby lymph nodes. The cells of this tumor usually have a certain genetic change called a translocation part of one chromosome switches places with part of another chromosome. In order to diagnose clear cell sarcoma of soft tissue the tumor cells are checked for this genetic change. - Desmoplastic small round cell tumor . This tumor most often forms in the abdomen pelvis or tissues around the testes but it may form in the kidney. Desmoplastic small round cell tumor may also spread to the lungs and other parts of the body. The cells of this tumor usually have a certain genetic change called a translocation part of one chromosome switches places with part of another chromosome. In order to diagnose desmoplastic small round cell tumor the tumor cells are checked for this genetic change. - Epithelioid sarcoma . This is a rare sarcoma that usually starts deep in soft tissue as a slow growing firm lump and may spread to the lymph nodes. - Extrarenal extracranial rhabdoid tumor . This is a rare fast-growing tumor of soft tissues such as the liver and peritoneum. It usually occurs in young children including newborns but it can occur in older children and adults. Rhabdoid tumors may be linked to a change in a tumor suppressor gene called SMARCB1. This type of gene makes a protein that helps control cell growth. Changes in the SMARCB1 gene may be inherited passed on from parents to offspring. Genetic counseling a discussion with a trained professional about inherited diseases and a possible need for gene testing may be needed. - Extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma . This is a rare soft tissue sarcoma that may be found in children and adolescents. Over time it tends to spread to other parts of the body including the lymph nodes and lungs. The cells of this tumor usually have a genetic change often a translocation part of one chromosome switches places with part of another chromosome. In order to diagnose extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma the tumor cells are checked for this genetic change. The tumor may come back many years after treatment. - Perivascular epithelioid cell tumors PEComas. Benign not cancer PEComas may be found in children with an inherited condition called tuberous sclerosis. They occur in the stomach intestines lungs female reproductive organs and genitourinary organs. - Primitive neuroectodermal tumor PNETextraskeletal Ewing tumor . See the PDQ summary on Ewing Sarcoma Treatment for information. - Synovial sarcoma . Synovial sarcoma is a common type of soft tissue sarcoma in children and adolescents. Synovial sarcoma usually forms in the tissues around the joints in the arms or legs but may also form in the trunk head or neck. The cells of this tumor usually have a certain genetic change called a translocation part of one chromosome switches places with part of another chromosome. Larger tumors have a greater risk of spreading to other parts of the body including the lungs. Children younger than 10 years and those whose tumor is 5 centimeters or smaller have a better prognosis. - Undifferentiated unclassified sarcoma . These tumors usually occur in the muscles that are attached to bones and that help the body move. - Undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma malignant fibrous histiocytoma high-grade. This type of soft tissue tumor may form in parts of the body where patients have received radiation therapy in the past or as a second cancer in children with retinoblastoma. The tumor is usually found on the arms or legs and may spread to other parts of the body. See the PDQ summary on Osteosarcoma and Malignant Fibrous Histiocytoma of Bone Treatment for information about malignant fibrous histiocytoma of bone. Blood vessel tumors Blood vessel tumors include the following types - Angiosarcoma of the soft tissue. Angiosarcoma of the soft tissue is a fast-growing tumor that forms in blood vessels or lymph vessels in any part of the body. Most angiosarcomas are in or just under the skin. Those in deeper soft tissue can form in the liver spleen and lung. They are very rare in children who sometimes have more than one tumor in the skin or liver. Rarely infantile hemangioma may become angiosarcoma of the soft tissue. See the PDQ summary on Childhood Vascular Tumors Treatment for more information. - Epithelioid hemangioendothelioma. Epithelioid hemangioendotheliomas can occur in children but are most common in adults between 30 and 50 years of age. They usually occur in the liver lung or bone. They may be either fast growing or slow growing. In about a third of cases the tumor spreads to other parts of the body very quickly. See the PDQ summary on Childhood Vascular Tumors Treatment for more information.

        "instruction": "What is are Childhood Vascular Tumors ",
        "output": "Key Points - Childhood vascular tumors form from cells that make blood vessels or lymph vessels. - Tests are used to detect find and diagnose childhood vascular tumors. - Childhood vascular tumors may be classified into four groups. - Benign tumors - Intermediate locally aggressive tumors - Intermediate rarely metastasizing tumors - Malignant tumors Childhood vascular tumors form from cells that make blood vessels or lymph vessels. Vascular tumors can form from abnormal blood vessel or lymph vessel cells anywhere in the body. They may be benign not cancer or malignant cancer. There are many types of vascular tumors. The most common type of childhood vascular tumor is hemangioma which is a benign tumor that usually goes away on its own. Because malignant vascular tumors are rare in children there is not a lot of information about what treatment works best. Childhood vascular tumors may be classified into four groups. Benign tumors Benign tumors are not cancer. This summary has information about the following benign vascular tumors - Infantile hemangioma. - Congenital hemangioma. - Benign vascular tumors of the liver. - Spindle cell hemangioma. - Epithelioid hemangioma. - Pyogenic granuloma lobular capillary hemangioma. - Angiofibroma. - Juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma. Intermediate locally aggressive tumors Intermediate tumors that are locally aggressive often spread to the area around the tumor. This summary has information about the following locally aggressive vascular tumors - Kaposiform hemangioendothelioma and tufted angioma. Intermediate rarely metastasizing tumors Intermediate rarely metastasizing tumors sometimes spread to other parts of the body. This summary has information about the following vascular tumors that rarely metastasize - Retiform hemangioendothelioma. - Papillary intralymphatic angioendothelioma. - Composite hemangioendothelioma. - Kaposi sarcoma. Malignant tumors Malignant tumors are cancer. This summary has information about the following malignant vascular tumors - Epithelioid hemangioendothelioma. - Angiosarcoma of soft tissue. Benign Tumors Infantile Hemangioma Infantile hemangiomas are the most common type of benign vascular tumor in children. An infantile hemangioma may also be called a strawberry mark. Immature cells that are meant to form blood vessels form a tumor instead. These tumors are not usually seen at birth but appear when the infant is 3 to 6 weeks old. Most hemangiomas get bigger for about 5 months then stop growing and slowly fade away completely during the next several years. It is rare for them to come back. Hemangiomas may be on the skin in the tissue below the skin andor in an organ. They are usually on the head and neck but can be anywhere on or in the body. Hemangiomas may appear as a single lesion one or more lesions spread over a larger area of the body or multiple lesions in more than one part of the body. Lesions that are spread over a larger area of the body or multiple lesions are more likely to cause problems. Risk Factors Anything that increases your risk of getting a disease is called a risk factor. Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get the disease not having risk factors doesnt mean that you will not get the disease. Talk with your child is doctor if you think your child may be at risk. Infantile hemangiomas are more common in the following - Girls. - Whites. - Premature babies. - Twins triplets or other multiple births. - Babies of mothers who are older at time of the pregnancy or who have problems with the placenta during pregnancy. Other risk factors for infantile hemangiomas include the following - Having certain syndromes. - PHACE syndrome A syndrome in which the hemangioma spreads across a large area of the body usually the head or face. Other health problems involving the large blood vessels heart eyes andor brain may also occur. - LUMBARPELVISSACRAL syndrome A syndrome in which the hemangioma spreads across a large area of the lower back. Other health problems that affect the urinary system genitals rectum anus brain spinal cord and nerve function may also occur. Having more than one hemangioma or an airway hemangioma increases the risk of having other health problems. - Multiple hemangiomas Having more than five hemangiomas on the skin is a sign that there may be hemangiomas in an organ most commonly the liver. Heart muscle and thyroid gland problems can also occur. - Airway hemangiomas Hemangiomas in the airway usually occur along with a large beard-shaped area of hemangioma on the face from the ears around the mouth lower chin and front of neck. It is important for airway hemangiomas to be treated before the child has trouble breathing. Signs and Symptoms Infantile hemangiomas may cause any of the following signs and symptoms. Check with your childs doctor if your child has any of the following - Skin lesions An area of spidery veins or lightened or discolored skin may appear before the hemangioma does. Hemangiomas occur as firm warm bright red-blue lesions on the skin. Lesions that form ulcers are also painful. Later as the hemangiomas go away they begin fading in the center before flattening and losing color. - Lesions below the skin Lesions that grow under the skin in the fat may appear blue or purple. If the lesions are deep enough under the skin surface they may not be seen. - Lesions in an organ There may be no signs that hemangiomas have formed on an organ. Although most infantile hemangiomas are nothing to worry about if your child develops any lumps or red or blue marks on the skin check with your child is doctor. He or she can recommend a specialist if needed. Diagnostic Tests A physical exam and history are usually all that are needed to diagnose infantile hemangiomas. If there is something about the tumor that looks unusual a biopsy may be done. If the hemangioma is deeper inside the body with no change to the skin or the lesions are spread across a large area of the body an ultrasound or MRI may be done. See the General Information section for a description of these tests and procedures. If the hemangiomas are part of a syndrome more tests may be done such as an echocardiogram magnetic resonance angiogram and eye exam. Treatment Most hemangiomas fade and shrink without treatment. If the hemangioma is large or causing other health problems treatment may include the following - Propranolol or other beta-blocker therapy. - Steroid therapy before beta-blocker therapy is begun or when beta-blockers cannot be used. - Pulsed dye laser surgery for hemangiomas that have ulcers or have not gone away. - Surgery excision for hemangiomas that have ulcers cause vision problems or have not gone away. - Topical beta-blocker therapy for hemangiomas that are in one area of the skin. - Combined therapy such as propranolol and steroid therapy or propranolol and topical beta-blocker therapy. Congenital Hemangioma Congenital hemangioma is a benign vascular tumor that begins forming before birth and is fully formed when the baby is born. They are usually on the skin but can be in another organ. There are three types of congenital hemangiomas - Rapidly Involuting Congenital Hemangioma These tumors go away on their own 12 to 15 months after birth. They can form ulcers bleed and cause temporary heart and blood clotting problems. The skin may look a little different even after the hemangiomas go away. - Partial Involuting Congenital Hemangioma These tumors do not go away completely. - Non-Involuting Congenital Hemangioma These tumors never go away on their own. Diagnostic Tests See the General Information section for a description of tests and procedures used to diagnose congenital hemangioma. Treatment Treatment of rapidly involuting congenital hemangioma and partial involuting congenital hemangioma may include the following - Observation only. Treatment of non-involuting congenital hemangioma may include the following - Surgery to remove the tumor depending on where it is and whether it is causing symptoms. Benign Vascular Tumors of the Liver Benign vascular tumors of the liver may be focal a single lesion in one area of the liver multifocal multiple lesions in one area of the liver or diffuse multiple lesions in more than one area of the liver. The liver has many functions including filtering blood and making proteins needed for blood clotting. Sometimes blood that normally flows through the liver is blocked or slowed by the tumor. This sends blood directly to the heart without going through the liver and is called a liver shunt. This can cause heart failure and problems with blood clotting. Focal Tumors Focal tumors are usually rapidly involuting congenital hemangiomas or non-involuting congenital hemangiomas. Diagnostic Tests See the General Information section for a description of tests and procedures used to diagnose focal benign vascular tumors. Treatment Treatment of focal tumors of the liver depends on whether symptoms occur and may include the following - Observation. - Drugs to manage symptoms including heart failure and blood clotting problems. - Embolization of the liver to manage symptoms including heart failure. Multifocal and Diffuse Tumors Multifocal and diffuse tumors of the liver are usually infantile hemangiomas. Diffuse tumors of the liver can cause serious effects including problems with the thyroid gland and heart. The liver can enlarge press on other organs and cause more symptoms. Diagnostic Tests See the General Information section for a description of tests and procedures used to diagnose multifocal or diffuse benign vascular tumors. Treatment Treatment of multifocal and diffuse liver tumors may include the following - Observation for multifocal tumors of the liver that do not cause symptoms. - Beta-blocker therapy propranolol. - Chemotherapy. - Steroid therapy. - Total hepatectomy and liver transplant when the tumors do not respond to drug therapy. This is only done when the tumors have spread widely in the liver and more than one organ has failed. If a vascular tumor of the liver does not respond to standard treatments a biopsy may be done to see if the tumor has become malignant. Spindle Cell Hemangioma Spindle cell hemangiomas contain cells called spindle cells. Under a microscope spindle cells look long and slender. Risk Factors Anything that increases your risk of getting a disease is called a risk factor. Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get the disease not having risk factors doesnt mean that you will not get the disease. Talk with your child is doctor if you think your child may be at risk. Spindle cell hemangiomas are likely to occur in children with the following syndromes - Maffucci syndrome which affects cartilage and skin. - Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome which affects blood vessels soft tissues and bones. Signs Spindle cell hemangiomas appear on or under the skin. They are painful red-brown or bluish lesions that usually appear on the arms or legs. They can begin as one lesion and develop into more lesions over years. Diagnostic Tests See the General Information section for a description of tests and procedures used to diagnose spindle cell hemangioma. Treatment There is no standard treatment for spindle cell hemangiomas. Treatment may include the following - Surgery to remove the tumor. Spindle cell hemangiomas may come back after surgery. Epithelioid Hemangioma Epithelioid hemangiomas usually form on or in the skin especially the head but can occur in other areas such as bone. Signs and Symptoms Epithelioid hemangiomas are sometimes caused by injury. On the skin they may appear as firm pink to red bumps and may be itchy. Epithelioid hemangioma of the bone may cause swelling pain and weakened bone in the affected area. Diagnostic Tests See the General Information section for a description of tests and procedures used to diagnose epithelioid hemangioma. Treatment There is no standard treatment for epithelioid hemangiomas. Treatment may include the following - Surgery curettage or resection. - Sclerotherapy. - Radiation therapy in rare cases. Epithelioid hemangiomas often come back after treatment. Pyogenic Granuloma Pyogenic granuloma is also called lobular capillary hemangioma. It is most common in older children and young adults but may occur at any age. The lesions are sometimes caused by injury or from the use of certain medicines including birth control pills and retinoids. They may also form for no known reason inside capillaries the smallest blood vessels or other places on the body. Usually there is only one lesion but sometimes multiple lesions occur in the same area or the lesions may spread to other areas of the body. Signs Pyogenic granulomas are raised bright red lesions that may be small or large and smooth or bumpy. They grow quickly over weeks to months and may bleed a lot. Diagnostic Tests See the General Information section for a description of tests and procedures used to diagnose pyogenic granuloma. Treatment Some pyogenic granulomas go away without treatment. Other pyogenic granulomas need treatment that may include the following - Surgery excision or curettage to remove the lesion. - Laser photocoagulation. Pyogenic granulomas often come back after treatment. Angiofibroma Angiofibromas are rare. They are benign skin lesions that usually occur with a condition called tuberous sclerosis an inherited disorder that causes skin lesions seizures and mental disabilities. Signs Angiofibromas appear as red bumps on the face. Diagnostic Tests See the General Information section for a description of tests and procedures used to diagnose angiofibroma. Treatment Treatment of angiofibromas may include the following - Surgery excision to remove the tumor. - Laser therapy. - Targeted therapy sirolimus. Juvenile Nasopharyngeal Angiofibroma Juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibromas are benign tumors but they can invade nearby tissue. They begin in the nasal cavity and may spread to the nasopharynx the paranasal sinuses the bone around the eyes and sometimes to the brain. Diagnostic Tests See the General Information section for a description of tests and procedures used to diagnose juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma. Treatment Treatment of juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibromas may include the following - Surgery excision to remove the tumor. - Radiation therapy. - Chemotherapy. - Immunotherapy interferon. - Targeted therapy sirolimus. Intermediate Tumors that Spread Locally Kaposiform Hemangioendothelioma and Tufted Angioma Kaposiform hemangioendotheliomas and tufted angiomas are blood vessel tumors that occur in infants or during early childhood. These tumors can cause Kasabach-Merritt phenomenon a condition in which the blood is not able to clot and serious bleeding may occur. In Kasabach-Merritt phenomenon the tumor traps and destroys platelets blood-clotting cells. Then there are not enough platelets in the blood when needed to stop bleeding. This type of vascular tumor is not related to Kaposi sarcoma. Signs and Symptoms Kaposiform hemangioendotheliomas and tufted angiomas usually occur on the skin of the arms and legs but may also form in deeper tissues such as muscle or bone. Signs and symptoms may include the following - Firm painful areas of skin that look bruised. - Purple or brownish-red areas of skin. - Easy bruising. - Bleeding more than the usual amount from mucous membranes wounds and other tissues. - Anemia weakness feeling tired or looking pale. Diagnostic Tests See the General Information section for a description of tests and procedures used to diagnose kaposiform hemangioendothelioma. If a physical exam and MRI clearly show the tumor is a kaposiform hemangioendothelioma or a tufted angioma a biopsy may not be needed. A biopsy is not always done because serious bleeding can occur. Treatment Treatment of kaposiform hemangioendotheliomas and tufted angiomas depends on the child is symptoms. Infection delay in treatment and surgery can cause bleeding that is life-threatening. Kaposiform hemangioendotheliomas and tufted angiomas are best treated by a vascular anomaly specialist. Treatment and supportive care to manage bleeding may include the following - Steroid therapy which may be followed by chemotherapy. - Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs NSAID such as aspirin. - Immunotherapy interferon. - Antifibrinolytic therapy to improve blood clotting. - Chemotherapy with one or more anticancer drugs. - Beta-blocker therapy propranolol. - Surgery excision to remove the tumor with or without embolization. - Targeted therapy sirolimus. - A clinical trial of targeted therapy sirolimus and steroid therapy. Even with treatment these tumors do not fully go away and can come back. Long-term effects include chronic pain heart failure bone problems and lymphedema the build up of lymph fluid in tissues. Intermediate Tumors that Rarely Spread Retiform Hemangioendothelioma Retiform hemangioendotheliomas are slow growing flat tumors that occur in young adults and sometimes children. These tumors usually occur on or under the skin of the arms legs and trunk. These tumors often come back after treatment but they usually do not spread to other parts of the body. Diagnostic Tests See the General Information section for a description of tests and procedures used to diagnose retiform hemangioendothelioma. Treatment Treatment of retiform hemangioendotheliomas may include the following - Surgery excision to remove the tumor. Follow up will include monitoring to see if the tumor comes back. - Radiation therapy and chemotherapy when surgery cannot be done or when the tumor has come back. Papillary Intralymphatic Angioendothelioma Papillary intralymphatic angioendotheliomas are also called Dabska tumors. These tumors form in or under the skin anywhere on the body. The tumors contain channels that look like lymph vessels. Lymph nodes are sometimes affected. Signs Papillary intralymphatic angioendotheliomas may appear as firm raised purplish bumps which may be small or large. These tumors grow slowly over time. Diagnostic Tests See the General Information section for a description of tests and procedures used to diagnose papillary intralymphatic angioendothelioma. Treatment Treatment of papillary intralymphatic angioendotheliomas may include the following - Surgery excision to remove the tumor. Composite Hemangioendothelioma Composite hemangioendotheliomas have features of both benign and malignant vascular tumors. These tumors usually occur on or under the skin on the arms or legs. They may also occur on the head neck or chest. Composite hemangioendotheliomas are not likely to metastasize spread but they may come back in the same place. When the tumors metastasize they usually spread to nearby lymph nodes. Diagnostic Tests See the General Information section for a description of tests and procedures used to diagnose composite hemangioendothelioma and find out whether the tumor has spread. Treatment Treatment of composite hemangioendotheliomas may include the following - Surgery to remove the tumor. - Radiation therapy and chemotherapy for tumors that have spread. Kaposi Sarcoma Kaposi sarcoma is a cancer that causes lesions to grow in the skin the mucous membranes lining the mouth nose and throat lymph nodes or other organs. It is caused by the Kaposi sarcoma herpes virus KSHV. In the United States it usually occurs in people who have a weak immune system caused by AIDS or by drugs used in organ transplants. It is very rare in children and can be caused by HIV infection and rare immune system disorders. Signs Signs in children may include the following - Lesions in the skin mouth or throat. Skin lesions are red purple or brown and change from flat to raised to scaly areas called plaques to nodules. - Swollen lymph nodes. Diagnostic Tests See the General Information section for a description of tests and procedures used to diagnose Kaposi sarcoma. Treatment Treatment of Kaposi sarcoma may include the following - Chemotherapy. See the PDQ summary on Kaposi Sarcoma Treatment for information about Kaposi sarcoma in adults. Malignant Tumors Epithelioid Hemangioendothelioma Epithelioid hemangioendotheliomas can occur in children but are most common in adults between 30 and 50 years of age. They usually occur in the liver lung or in bone. They may be either fast growing or slow growing. In about a third of cases the tumor spreads to other parts of the body very quickly. Signs and Symptoms Signs and symptoms depend on where the tumor is - On the skin the tumors can be raised and rounded or flat red-brown patches that feel warm. - In the lung there may be no early symptoms. Signs and symptoms that occur may include - Chest pain. - Spitting up blood. - Anemia weakness feeling tired or looking pale. - Trouble breathing from scarred lung tissue. - In bone the tumors can cause breaks. Diagnostic Tests Epithelioid hemangioendotheliomas in the liver are found with CT scans and MRI scans. See the General Information section for a description of these tests and procedures used to diagnose epithelioid hemangioendothelioma and find out whether the tumor has spread. X-rays may also be done. Treatment Treatment of slow-growing epithelioid hemangioendotheliomas includes the following - Observation. Treatment of fast-growing epithelioid hemangioendotheliomas may include the following - Surgery to remove the tumor when possible. - Immunotherapy interferon and targeted therapy thalidomide sorafenib pazopanib sirolimus for tumors that are likely to spread. - Chemotherapy. - Total hepatectomy and liver transplant when the tumor is in the liver. Angiosarcoma of the Soft Tissue Angiosarcomas are fast-growing tumors that form in blood vessels or lymph vessels in any part of the body usually in soft tissue. Most angiosarcomas are in or near the skin. Those in deeper soft tissue can form in the liver spleen and lung. These tumors are very rare in children. Children sometimes have more than one tumor in the skin andor liver. Risk Factors Anything that increases your risk of getting a disease is called a risk factor. Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get the disease not having risk factors doesnt mean that you will not get the disease. Talk with your child is doctor if you think your child may be at risk. Risk factors for angiosarcomas include the following - Being exposed to radiation. - Chronic long-term lymphedema a condition in which extra lymph fluid builds up in tissues and causes swelling. - Having a benign vascular tumor. A benign tumor such as a hemangioma may become an angiosarcoma but this rare. Signs Signs of angiosarcoma depend on where the tumor is and may include the following - Red patches on the skin that bleed easily. - Purple tumors. Diagnostic Tests See the General Information section for a description of tests and procedures used to diagnose angiosarcoma and find out whether the tumor has spread. Treatment Treatment of angiosarcoma may include the following - Surgery to completely remove the tumor. - A combination of surgery chemotherapy and radiation therapy for angiosarcomas that have spread. - Targeted therapy bevacizumab and chemotherapy for angiosarcomas that began as infantile hemangiomas. - A clinical trial of targeted therapy radiation therapy and surgery with or without chemotherapy."

        "output": "Key Points - Adult non-Hodgkin lymphoma is a disease in which malignant cancer cells form in the lymph system. - The major types of lymphoma are Hodgkin lymphoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. - Non-Hodgkin lymphoma can be indolent or aggressive. - Age gender and a weakened immune system can affect the risk of adult non-Hodgkin lymphoma. - Signs and symptoms of adult non-Hodgkin lymphoma include swelling in the lymph nodes fever night sweats weight loss and fatigue. - Tests that examine the body and lymph system are used to help detect find and diagnose adult non-Hodgkin lymphoma. - Certain factors affect prognosis chance of recovery and treatment options. Adult non-Hodgkin lymphoma is a disease in which malignant cancer cells form in the lymph system. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma is a type of cancer that forms in the lymph system which is part of the body is immune system. The immune system protects the body from foreign substances infection and diseases. The lymph system is made up of the following - Lymph Colorless watery fluid that carries white blood cells called lymphocytes through the lymph system. Lymphocytes protect the body against infection and the growth of tumors. There are three types of lymphocytes - B lymphocytes that make antibodies to help fight infection. Also called B cells. Most types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma begin in B lymphocytes. - T lymphocytes that help B lymphocytes make the antibodies that help fight infection. Also called T cells. - Natural killer cells that attack cancer cells and viruses. Also called NK cells. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma can begin in B lymphocytes T lymphocytes or natural killer cells. Lymphocytes can also be found in the blood and also collect in the lymph nodes spleen and thymus. - Lymph vessels A network of thin tubes that collect lymph from different parts of the body and return it to the bloodstream. - Lymph nodes Small bean-shaped structures that filter lymph and store white blood cells that help fight infection and disease. Lymph nodes are located along the network of lymph vessels found throughout the body. Clusters of lymph nodes are found in the neck underarm abdomen pelvis and groin. - Spleen An organ that makes lymphocytes filters the blood stores blood cells and destroys old blood cells. It is on the left side of the abdomen near the stomach. - Thymus An organ in which lymphocytes grow and multiply. The thymus is in the chest behind the breastbone. - Tonsils Two small masses of lymph tissue at the back of the throat. The tonsils make lymphocytes. - Bone marrow The soft spongy tissue in the center of large bones. Bone marrow makes white blood cells red blood cells and platelets. Lymph tissue is also found in other parts of the body such as the stomach thyroid gland brain and skin. Cancer can spread to the liver and lungs. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma during pregnancy is rare. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma in pregnant women is the same as the disease in nonpregnant women of childbearing age. However treatment is different for pregnant women. This summary includes information on the treatment of non-Hodgkin lymphoma during pregnancy see the Treatment Options for Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma During Pregnancy section for more information. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma can occur in both adults and children. Treatment for adults is different than treatment for children. See the PDQ summary on Childhood Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Treatment for more information. The major types of lymphoma are Hodgkin lymphoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Lymphomas are divided into two general types Hodgkin lymphoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. This summary is about the treatment of adult non-Hodgkin lymphoma. For information about certain types of lymphoma see the following PDQ summaries - Adult Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Treatment lymphoblastic lymphoma - Adult Hodgkin Lymphoma Treatment - AIDS-Related Lymphoma Treatment - Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Treatment small lymphocytic lymphoma - Mycosis Fungoides and the Szary Syndrome Treatment cutaneous T-cell lymphoma - Primary CNS Lymphoma Treatment Non-Hodgkin lymphoma can be indolent or aggressive. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma grows and spreads at different rates and can be indolent or aggressive. Indolent lymphoma tends to grow and spread slowly and has few signs and symptoms. Aggressive lymphoma grows and spreads quickly and has signs and symptoms that can be severe. The treatments for indolent and aggressive lymphoma are different. This summary is about the following types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma Indolent non-Hodgkin lymphomas - Follicular lymphoma. Follicular lymphoma is the most common type of indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma. It is a very slow-growing type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that begins in B lymphocytes. It affects the lymph nodes and may spread to the bone marrow or spleen. Most patients with follicular lymphoma are age 50 years and older when they are diagnosed. Follicular lymphoma may go away without treatment. The patient is closely watched for signs or symptoms that the disease has come back. Treatment is needed if signs or symptoms occur after the cancer disappeared or after initial cancer treatment. Sometimes follicular lymphoma can become a more aggressive type of lymphoma such as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. - Lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma. In most cases of lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma B lymphocytes that are turning into plasma cells make large amounts of a protein called monoclonal immunoglobulin M IgM antibody. High levels of IgM antibody in the blood cause the blood plasma to thicken. This may cause signs or symptoms such as trouble seeing or hearing heart problems shortness of breath headache dizziness and numbness or tingling of the hands and feet. Sometimes there are no signs or symptoms of lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma. It may be found when a blood test is done for another reason. Lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma often spreads to the bone marrow lymph nodes and spleen. It is also called Waldenstrm macroglobulinemia. - Marginal zone lymphoma. This type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma begins in B lymphocytes in a part of lymph tissue called the marginal zone. There are five different types of marginal zone lymphoma. They are grouped by the type of tissue where the lymphoma formed - Nodal marginal zone lymphoma. Nodal marginal zone lymphoma forms in lymph nodes. This type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma is rare. It is also called monocytoid B-cell lymphoma. - Gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue MALT lymphoma. Gastric MALT lymphoma usually begins in the stomach. This type of marginal zone lymphoma forms in cells in the mucosa that help make antibodies. Patients with gastric MALT lymphoma may also have Helicobacter gastritis or an autoimmune disease such as Hashimoto thyroiditis or Sjgren syndrome. - Extragastric MALT lymphoma. Extragastric MALT lymphoma begins outside of the stomach in almost every part of the body including other parts of the gastrointestinal tract salivary glands thyroid lung skin and around the eye. This type of marginal zone lymphoma forms in cells in the mucosa that help make antibodies. Extragastric MALT lymphoma may come back many years after treatment. - Mediterranean abdominal lymphoma. This is a type of MALT lymphoma that occurs in young adults in eastern Mediterranean countries. It often forms in the abdomen and patients may also be infected with bacteria called Campylobacter jejuni. This type of lymphoma is also called immunoproliferative small intestinal disease. - Splenic marginal zone lymphoma. This type of marginal zone lymphoma begins in the spleen and may spread to the peripheral blood and bone marrow. The most common sign of this type of splenic marginal zone lymphoma is a spleen that is larger than normal. - Primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma. This type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma is in the skin only. It can be a benign not cancer nodule that may go away on its own or it can spread to many places on the skin and need treatment. Aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphomas - Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is the most common type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. It grows quickly in the lymph nodes and often the spleen liver bone marrow or other organs are also affected. Signs and symptoms of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma may include fever recurring night sweats and weight loss. These are also called B symptoms. Primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma is a type of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. - Primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma. This type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma is marked by the overgrowth of fibrous scar-like lymph tissue. A tumor most often forms behind the breastbone. It may press on the airways and cause coughing and trouble breathing. Most patients with primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma are women who are age 30 to 40 years. - Follicular large cell lymphoma stage III. Follicular large cell lymphoma stage III is a very rare type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. It is more like diffuse large B-cell lymphoma than other types of follicular lymphoma. - Anaplastic large cell lymphoma. Anaplastic large cell lymphoma is a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that usually begins in T lymphocytes. The cancer cells also have a marker called CD30 on the surface of the cell. There are two types of anaplastic large cell lymphoma - Cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma. This type of anaplastic large cell lymphoma mostly affects the skin but other parts of the body may also be affected. Signs of cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma include one or more bumps or ulcers on the skin. - Systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma. This type of anaplastic large cell lymphoma begins in the lymph nodes and may affect other parts of the body. Patients may have a lot of anaplastic lymphoma kinase ALK protein inside the lymphoma cells. These patients have a better prognosis than patients who do not have extra ALK protein. Systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma is more common in children than adults. See the PDQ summary on Childhood Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Treatment for more information. - Extranodal NK -T-cell lymphoma. Extranodal NK-T-cell lymphoma usually begins in the area around the nose. It may also affect the paranasal sinus hollow spaces in the bones around the nose roof of the mouth trachea skin stomach and intestines. Most cases of extranodal NK-T-cell lymphoma have Epstein-Barr virus in the tumor cells. Sometimes hemophagocytic syndrome occurs a serious condition in which there are too many active histiocytes and T cells that cause severe inflammation in the body. Treatment to suppress the immune system is needed. This type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma is not common in the United States. - Lymphomatoid granulomatosis. Lymphomatoid granulomatosis mostly affects the lungs. It may also affect the paranasal sinuses hollow spaces in the bones around the nose skin kidneys and central nervous system. In lymphomatoid granulomatosis cancer invades the blood vessels and kills tissue. Because the cancer may spread to the brain intrathecal chemotherapy or radiation therapy to the brain is given. - Angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma. This type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma begins in T cells. Swollen lymph nodes are a common sign. Other signs may include a skin rash fever weight loss or night sweats. There may also be high levels of gamma globulin antibodies in the blood. Patients may also have opportunistic infections because their immune systems are weakened. - Peripheral T-cell lymphoma. Peripheral T-cell lymphoma begins in mature T lymphocytes. This type of T lymphocyte matures in the thymus gland and travels to other lymphatic sites in the body such as the lymph nodes bone marrow and spleen. There are three subtypes of peripheral T-cell lymphoma - Hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma. This is an uncommon type of peripheral T-cell lymphoma that occurs mostly in young men. It begins in the liver and spleen and the cancer cells also have a T-cell receptor called gammadelta on the surface of the cell. - Subcutaneous panniculitis-like T-cell lymphoma. Subcutaneous panniculitis-like T-cell lymphoma begins in the skin or mucosa. It may occur with hemophagocytic syndrome a serious condition in which there are too many active histiocytes and T cells that cause severe inflammation in the body. Treatment to suppress the immune system is needed. - Enteropathy-type intestinal T-cell lymphoma. This type of peripheral T-cell lymphoma occurs in the small bowel of patients with untreated celiac disease an immune response to gluten that causes malnutrition. Patients who are diagnosed with celiac disease in childhood and stay on a gluten-free diet rarely develop enteropathy-type intestinal T-cell lymphoma. - Intravascular large B-cell lymphoma. This type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma affects blood vessels especially the small blood vessels in the brain kidney lung and skin. Signs and symptoms of intravascular large B-cell lymphoma are caused by blocked blood vessels. It is also called intravascular lymphomatosis. - Burkitt lymphoma. Burkitt lymphoma is a type of B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma that grows and spreads very quickly. It may affect the jaw bones of the face bowel kidneys ovaries or other organs. There are three main types of Burkitt lymphoma endemic sporadic and immunodeficiency related. Endemic Burkitt lymphoma commonly occurs in Africa and is linked to the Epstein-Barr virus and sporadic Burkitt lymphoma occurs throughout the world. Immunodeficiency-related Burkitt lymphoma is most often seen in patients who have AIDS. Burkitt lymphoma may spread to the brain and spinal cord and treatment to prevent its spread may be given. Burkitt lymphoma occurs most often in children and young adults See the PDQ summary on Childhood Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Treatment for more information. Burkitt lymphoma is also called diffuse small noncleaved-cell lymphoma. - Lymphoblastic lymphoma. Lymphoblastic lymphoma may begin in T cells or B cells but it usually begins in T cells. In this type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma there are too many lymphoblasts immature white blood cells in the lymph nodes and the thymus gland. These lymphoblasts may spread to other places in the body such as the bone marrow brain and spinal cord. Lymphoblastic lymphoma is most common in teenagers and young adults. It is a lot like acute lymphoblastic leukemia lymphoblasts are mostly found in the bone marrow and blood. See the PDQ summary on Adult Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Treatment for more information. - Adult T-cell leukemialymphoma. Adult T-cell leukemialymphoma is caused by the human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 HTLV-1. Signs include bone and skin lesions high blood calcium levels and lymph nodes spleen and liver that are larger than normal. - Mantle cell lymphoma. Mantle cell lymphoma is a type of B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma that usually occurs in middle-aged or older adults. It begins in the lymph nodes and spreads to the spleen bone marrow blood and sometimes the esophagus stomach and intestines. Patients with mantle cell lymphoma have too much of a protein called cyclin-D1 or a certain gene change in the lymphoma cells. In some patients who do not have signs or symptoms of lymphoma delaying the start of treatment does not affect the prognosis. - Posttransplantation lymphoproliferative disorder. This disease occurs in patients who have had a heart lung liver kidney or pancreas transplant and need lifelong immunosuppressive therapy. Most posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorders affect the B cells and have Epstein-Barr virus in the cells. Lymphoproliferative disorders are often treated like cancer. - True histiocytic lymphoma. This is a rare very aggressive type of lymphoma. It is not known whether it begins in B cells or T cells. It does not respond well to treatment with standard chemotherapy. - Primary effusion lymphoma. Primary effusion lymphoma begins in B cells that are found in an area where there is a large build-up of fluid such as the areas between the lining of the lung and chest wall pleural effusion the sac around the heart and the heart pericardial effusion or in the abdominal cavity. There is usually no tumor that can be seen. This type of lymphoma often occurs in patients who have AIDS. - Plasmablastic lymphoma. Plasmablastic lymphoma is a type of large B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma that is very aggressive. It is most often seen in patients with HIV infection."

AIDS-related lymphoma is a disease in which malignant cancer cells form in the lymph system of patients who have acquired immunodeficiency syndrome AIDS. AIDS is caused by the human immunodeficiency virus HIV which attacks and weakens the body is immune system. The immune system is then unable to fight infection and disease. People with HIV disease have an increased risk of infection and lymphoma or other types of cancer. A person with HIV disease who develops certain types of infections or cancer is then diagnosed with AIDS. Sometimes people are diagnosed with AIDS and AIDS-related lymphoma at the same time. For information about AIDS and its treatment please see the AIDSinfo website. AIDS-related lymphoma is a type of cancer that affects the lymph system which is part of the body is immune system. The immune system protects the body from foreign substances infection and diseases.

Lymphomas are divided into two general types - Hodgkin lymphoma. - Non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Both Hodgkin lymphoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma may occur in patients with AIDS but non-Hodgkin lymphoma is more common. When a person with AIDS has non-Hodgkin lymphoma it is called AIDS-related lymphoma. When AIDS-related lymphoma occurs in the central nervous system CNS it is called AIDS-related primary CNS lymphoma. Non-Hodgkin lymphomas are grouped by the way their cells look under a microscope. They may be indolent slow-growing or aggressive fast-growing. AIDS-related lymphomas are aggressive. There are two main types of AIDS-related non-Hodgkin lymphoma - Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma including B-cell immunoblastic lymphoma. - Burkitt or Burkitt-like lymphoma.

        "output": "Key Points - There are different types of treatment for patients with AIDS-related lymphoma. - Treatment of AIDS-related lymphoma combines treatment of the lymphoma with treatment for AIDS. - Four types of standard treatment are used - Chemotherapy - Radiation therapy - High-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant - Targeted therapy - New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials. - Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. - Patients can enter clinical trials before during or after starting their cancer treatment. - Follow-up tests may be needed. There are different types of treatment for patients with AIDS-related lymphoma. Different types of treatment are available for patients with AIDS-related lymphoma. Some treatments are standard the currently used treatment and some are being tested in clinical trials. A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment the new treatment may become the standard treatment. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment. Treatment of AIDS-related lymphoma combines treatment of the lymphoma with treatment for AIDS. Patients with AIDS have weakened immune systems and treatment can cause the immune system to become even weaker. For this reason treating patients who have AIDS-related lymphoma is difficult and some patients may be treated with lower doses of drugs than lymphoma patients who do not have AIDS. Combined antiretroviral therapy cART is used to lessen the damage to the immune system caused by HIV. Treatment with combined antiretroviral therapy may allow some patients with AIDS-related lymphoma to safely receive anticancer drugs in standard or higher doses. In these patients treatment may work as well as it does in lymphoma patients who do not have AIDS. Medicine to prevent and treat infections which can be serious is also used. For more information about AIDS and its treatment please see the AIDSinfo website. Four types of standard treatment are used Chemotherapy Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body systemic chemotherapy. When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid intrathecal chemotherapy an organ or a body cavity such as the abdomen the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas regional chemotherapy. Combination chemotherapy is treatment using more than one anticancer drug. The way the chemotherapy is given depends on where the cancer has formed. Intrathecal chemotherapy may be used in patients who are more likely to have lymphoma in the central nervous system CNS. Chemotherapy is used in the treatment of AIDS-related peripheralsystemic lymphoma. It is not yet known whether it is best to give combined antiretroviral therapy at the same time as chemotherapy or after chemotherapy ends. Colony-stimulating factors are sometimes given together with chemotherapy. This helps lessen the side effects chemotherapy may have on the bone marrow. Radiation therapy Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy - External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer. - Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles seeds wires or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer. The way the radiation therapy is given depends on where the cancer has formed. External radiation therapy is used to treat AIDS-related primary CNS lymphoma. High-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant High-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant is a way of giving high doses of chemotherapy and replacing blood -forming cells destroyed by the cancer treatment. Stem cells immature blood cells are removed from the blood or bone marrow of the patient or a donor and are frozen and stored. After the chemotherapy is completed the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an infusion. These reinfused stem cells grow into and restore the body is blood cells. Targeted therapy Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells without harming normal cells. Monoclonal antibody therapy is a type of targeted therapy. Monoclonal antibody therapy is a cancer treatment that uses antibodies made in the laboratory from a single type of immune system cell. These antibodies can identify substances on cancer cells or normal substances that may help cancer cells grow. The antibodies attach to the substances and kill the cancer cells block their growth or keep them from spreading. Monoclonal antibodies are given by infusion. These may be used alone or to carry drugs toxins or radioactive material directly to cancer cells. Rituximab is used in the treatment of AIDS-related peripheralsystemic lymphoma. New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials. Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. For some patients taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment. Many of today is standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment. Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments they often answer important questions and help move research forward. Patients can enter clinical trials before during or after starting their cancer treatment. Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring coming back or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment. Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials. These have been retrieved from NCI is listing of clinical trials. Follow-up tests may be needed. Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated. Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue change or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests. Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred come back. These tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups. Treatment Options for AIDS-Related Lymphoma AIDS-Related PeripheralSystemic Lymphoma Treatment of AIDS-related peripheralsystemic lymphoma may include the following - Combination chemotherapy with or without targeted therapy. - High-dose chemotherapy and stem cell transplant for lymphoma that has not responded to treatment or has come back. - Intrathecal chemotherapy for lymphoma that is likely to spread to the central nervous system CNS.

The spleen is on the left side of the abdomen near the stomach. - Thymus An organ in which lymphocytes grow and multiply. The thymus is in the chest behind the breastbone. - Tonsils Two small masses of lymph tissue at the back of the throat. The tonsils make lymphocytes. - Bone marrow The soft spongy tissue in the center of large bones. Bone marrow makes white blood cells red blood cells and platelets. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma can begin in B lymphocytes T lymphocytes or natural killer cells. Lymphocytes can also be found in the blood and collect in the lymph nodes spleen and thymus. Lymph tissue is also found in other parts of the body such as the stomach thyroid gland brain and skin. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma can occur in both adults and children. Treatment for children is different than treatment for adults. See the following PDQ summaries for information about treatment of non-Hodgkin lymphoma in adults - Adult Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma - Primary CNS Lymphoma Treatment - Mycosis Fungoides and the Sezary Syndrome Treatment The main types of lymphoma are Hodgkin lymphoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Lymphomas are divided into two general types Hodgkin lymphoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. This summary is about the treatment of childhood non-Hodgkin lymphoma. See the PDQ summary on Childhood Hodgkin Lymphoma Treatment for information about childhood Hodgkin lymphoma. There are three major types of childhood non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The type of lymphoma is determined by how the cells look under a microscope. The three major types of childhood non-Hodgkin lymphoma are Mature B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma Mature B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas include - Burkitt and Burkitt-like lymphomaleukemia Burkitt lymphoma and Burkitt leukemia are different forms of the same disease. Burkitt lymphomaleukemia is an aggressive fast-growing disorder of B lymphocytes that is most common in children and young adults. It may form in the abdomen Waldeyer is ring testicles bone bone marrow skin or central nervous system CNS. Burkitt leukemia may start in the lymph nodes as Burkitt lymphoma and then spread to the blood and bone marrow or it may start in the blood and bone marrow without forming in the lymph nodes first. Both Burkitt leukemia and Burkitt lymphoma have been linked to infection with the Epstein-Barr virus EBV although EBV infection is more likely to occur in patients in Africa than in the United States. Burkitt and Burkitt-like lymphomaleukemia are diagnosed when a sample of tissue is checked and a certain change to the c-myc gene is found. - Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is the most common type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. It is a type of B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma that grows quickly in the lymph nodes. The spleen liver bone marrow or other organs are also often affected. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma occurs more often in adolescents than in children. - Primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma A type of lymphoma that develops from B cells in the mediastinum the area behind the breastbone. It may spread to nearby organs including the lungs and the sac around the heart. It may also spread to lymph nodes and distant organs including the kidneys. In children and adolescents primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma occurs more often in older adolescents. Lymphoblastic lymphoma Lymphoblastic lymphoma is a type of lymphoma that mainly affects T-cell lymphocytes. It usually forms in the mediastinum the area behind the breastbone. This causes trouble breathing wheezing trouble swallowing or swelling of the head and neck. It may spread to lymph nodes bone bone marrow skin the CNS abdominal organs and other areas. Lymphoblastic lymphoma is a lot like acute lymphoblastic leukemia ALL. Anaplastic large cell lymphoma Anaplastic large cell lymphoma is a type of lymphoma that mainly affects T-cell lymphocytes. It usually forms in the lymph nodes skin or bone and sometimes forms in the gastrointestinal tract lung tissue that covers the lungs and muscle. Patients with anaplastic large cell lymphoma have a receptor called CD30 on the surface of their T cells. In many children anaplastic large cell lymphoma is marked by changes in the ALK gene that makes a protein called anaplastic lymphoma kinase. A pathologist checks for these cell and gene changes to help diagnose anaplastic large cell lymphoma. Some types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma are rare in children. Some types of childhood non-Hodgkin lymphoma are less common. These include - Pediatric-type follicular lymphoma  In children follicular lymphoma occurs mainly in males. It is more likely to be found in one area and does not spread to other places in the body. It usually forms in the tonsils and lymph nodes in the neck but may also form in the testicles kidney gastrointestinal tract and salivary gland. - Marginal zone lymphoma  Marginal zone lymphoma is a type of lymphoma that tends to grow and spread slowly and is usually found at an early stage. It may be found in the lymph nodes or in areas outside the lymph nodes. Marginal zone lymphoma found outside the lymph nodes in children is called mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue MALT lymphoma and may be linked to Helicobacter pylori infection of the gastrointestinal tract and Chlamydophila psittaci infection of the conjunctival membrane which lines the eye. - Primary central nervous system CNS lymphoma  Primary CNS lymphoma is extremely rare in children. - Peripheral T-cell lymphoma  Peripheral T-cell lymphoma is an aggressive fast-growing non-Hodgkin lymphoma that begins in mature T lymphocytes. The T lymphocytes mature in the thymus gland and travel to other parts of the lymph system such as the lymph nodes bone marrow and spleen. - Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma  Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma begins in the skin and can cause the skin to thicken or form a tumor. It is very rare in children but is more common in adolescents and young adults. There are different types of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma such as cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma subcutaneous panniculitis-like T-cell lymphoma gamma-delta T-cell lymphoma and mycosis fungoides. Mycosis fungoides rarely occurs in children and adolescents. Past treatment for cancer and having a weakened immune system affect the risk of having childhood non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Anything that increases your risk of getting a disease is called a risk factor. Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer not having risk factors doesnt mean that you will not get cancer. Talk with your child is doctor if you think your child may be at risk. Possible risk factors for childhood non-Hodgkin lymphoma include the following - Past treatment for cancer. - Being infected with the Epstein-Barr virus or human immunodeficiency virus HIV. - Having a weakened immune system after a transplant or from medicines given after a transplant. - Having certain inherited diseases of the immune system. If lymphoma or lymphoproliferative disease is linked to a weakened immune system from certain inherited diseases HIV infection a transplant or medicines given after a transplant the condition is called lymphoproliferative disease associated with immunodeficiency. The different types of lymphoproliferative disease associated with immunodeficiency include - Lymphoproliferative disease associated with primary immunodeficiency. - HIV-associated non-Hodgkin lymphoma. - Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease."

        "output": "Key Points - There are different types of treatment for children with non-Hodgkin lymphoma. - Children with non-Hodgkin lymphoma should have their treatment planned by a team of doctors who are experts in treating childhood cancer. - Some cancer treatments cause side effects months or years after treatment has ended. - Six types of standard treatment are used - Chemotherapy - Radiation therapy - High-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant - Targeted therapy - Other drug therapy - Phototherapy - New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials. - Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. - Patients can enter clinical trials before during or after starting their cancer treatment. - Follow-up tests may be needed. There are different types of treatment for children with non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Different types of treatment are available for children with non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Some treatments are standard the currently used treatment and some are being tested in clinical trials. A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment the new treatment may become the standard treatment. Taking part in a clinical trial should be considered for all children with non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment. Children with non-Hodgkin lymphoma should have their treatment planned by a team of doctors who are experts in treating childhood cancer. Treatment will be overseen by a pediatric oncologist a doctor who specializes in treating children with cancer. The pediatric oncologist works with other health care providers who are experts in treating children with non-Hodgkin lymphoma and who specialize in certain areas of medicine. These may include the following specialists - Pediatrician. - Radiation oncologist. - Pediatric hematologist. - Pediatric surgeon. - Pediatric nurse specialist. - Rehabilitation specialist. - Psychologist. - Social worker. Some cancer treatments cause side effects months or years after treatment has ended. Side effects from cancer treatment that begin during or after treatment and continue for months or years are called late effects. Late effects of cancer treatment may include the following - Physical problems. - Changes in mood feelings thinking learning or memory. - Second cancers new types of cancer. Some late effects may be treated or controlled. It is important to talk with your child is doctors about the effects cancer treatment can have on your child. See the PDQ summary on Late Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer for more information. Six types of standard treatment are used Chemotherapy Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body systemic chemotherapy. When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid intrathecal chemotherapy an organ or a body cavity such as the abdomen the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas. Combination chemotherapy is treatment using two or more anticancer drugs. The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated. Intrathecal chemotherapy may be used to treat childhood non-Hodgkin lymphoma that has spread or may spread to the brain. When used to lessen the chance cancer will spread to the brain it is called CNS prophylaxis. Intrathecal chemotherapy is given in addition to chemotherapy by mouth or vein. Higher than usual doses of chemotherapy may also be used as CNS prophylaxis. See Drugs Approved for Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma for more information. Radiation therapy Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy - External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer. - Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles seeds wires or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer. The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma being treated. External radiation therapy may be used to treat childhood non-Hodgkin lymphoma that has spread or may spread to the brain and spinal cord. Internal radiation therapy is not used to treat non-Hodgkin lymphoma. High-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant This treatment is a way of giving high doses of chemotherapy and then replacing blood -forming cells destroyed by the cancer treatment. Stem cells immature blood cells are removed from the bone marrow or blood of the patient or a donor and are frozen and stored. After the chemotherapy is completed the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an infusion. These reinfused stem cells grow into and restore the bodys blood cells. See Drugs Approved for Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma for more information. Targeted therapy Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells without harming normal cells. Monoclonal antibodies tyrosine kinase inhibitors and immunotoxins are three types of targeted therapy being used or studied in the treatment of childhood non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Monoclonal antibody therapy is a cancer treatment that uses antibodies made in the laboratory from a single type of immune system cell. These antibodies can identify substances on cancer cells or normal substances that may help cancer cells grow. The antibodies attach to the substances and kill the cancer cells block their growth or keep them from spreading. Monoclonal antibodies are given by infusion. They may be used alone or to carry drugs toxins or radioactive material directly to cancer cells. - Rituximab is used to treat several types of childhood non-Hodgkin lymphoma. - Brentuximab vedotin is a monoclonal antibody combined with an anticancer drug that is used to treat anaplastic large cell lymphoma. A bispecific monoclonal antibody is made up of two different monoclonal antibodies that bind to two different substances and kills cancer cells. Bispecific monoclonal antibody therapy is used in the treatment of Burkitt and Burkitt-like lymphoma leukemia and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors TKIs block signals that tumors need to grow. Some TKIs also keep tumors from growing by preventing the growth of new blood vessels to the tumors. Other types of kinase inhibitors such as crizotinib are being studied for childhood non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Immunotoxins can bind to cancer cells and kill them. Denileukin diftitox is an immunotoxin used to treat cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. See Drugs Approved for Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma for more information. Other drug therapy Retinoids are drugs related to vitamin A. Retinoid therapy with bexarotene is used to treat several types of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. Steroids are hormones made naturally in the body. They can also be made in a laboratory and used as drugs. Steroid therapy is used to treat cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. Phototherapy Phototherapy is a cancer treatment that uses a drug and a certain type of laser light to kill cancer cells. A drug that is not active until it is exposed to light is injected into a vein. The drug collects more in cancer cells than in normal cells. For skin cancer in the skin laser light is shined onto the skin and the drug becomes active and kills the cancer cells. Phototherapy is used in the treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials. Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. For some patients taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment. Many of today is standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment. Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments they often answer important questions and help move research forward. Patients can enter clinical trials before during or after starting their cancer treatment. Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring coming back or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment. Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials. These have been retrieved from NCI is listing of clinical trials. Follow-up tests may be needed. Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated. Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue change or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests. Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your child is condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred come back. These tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups.

The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated. Surgery - Local resection A surgical procedure in which the tumor is cut from the anus along with some of the healthy tissue around it. Local resection may be used if the cancer is small and has not spread. This procedure may save the sphincter muscles so the patient can still control bowel movements. Tumors that form in the lower part of the anus can often be removed with local resection. - Abdominoperineal resection A surgical procedure in which the anus the rectum and part of the sigmoid colon are removed through an incision made in the abdomen. The doctor sews the end of the intestine to an opening called a stoma made in the surface of the abdomen so body waste can be collected in a disposable bag outside of the body. This is called a colostomy. Lymph nodes that contain cancer may also be removed during this operation. Having the human immunodeficiency virus can affect treatment of anal cancer. Cancer therapy can further damage the already weakened immune systems of patients who have the human immunodeficiency virus HIV. For this reason patients who have anal cancer and HIV are usually treated with lower doses of anticancer drugs and radiation than patients who do not have HIV. New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials. This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials. It may not mention every new treatment being studied. Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website. Radiosensitizers Radiosensitizers are drugs that make tumor cells more sensitive to radiation therapy. Combining radiation therapy with radiosensitizers may kill more tumor cells. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.

        "output": "Key Points - Avoiding risk factors and increasing protective factors may help prevent cancer. - The following are risk factors for anal cancer - Anal HPV infection - Certain medical conditions - History of cervical vaginal or vulvar cancer - HIV infectionAIDS - Immunosuppression - Certain sexual practices - Cigarette smoking - The following protective factor decreases the risk of anal cancer - HPV vaccine - It is not clear if the following protective factor decreases the risk of anal cancer - Condom use - Cancer prevention clinical trials are used to study ways to prevent cancer. - New ways to prevent anal cancer are being studied in clinical trials. Avoiding risk factors and increasing protective factors may help prevent cancer. Avoiding cancer risk factors may help prevent certain cancers. Risk factors include smoking being overweight and not getting enough exercise. Increasing protective factors such as quitting smoking and exercising may also help prevent some cancers. Talk to your doctor or other health care professional about how you might lower your risk of cancer. The following are risk factors for anal cancer Anal HPV infection Being infected with human papillomavirus HPV is the main risk factor for anal cancer. Being infected with HPV can lead to squamous cell carcinoma of the anus the most common type of anal cancer. About nine out of every ten cases of anal cancer are found in patients with anal HPV infection. Patients with healthy immune systems are usually able to fight HPV infections. Patients with weakened immune systems who are infected with HPV have a higher risk of anal cancer. Certain medical conditions History of cervical vaginal or vulvar cancer Cervical cancer vaginal cancer and vulvar cancer are related to HPV infection. Women who have had cervical vaginal or vulvar cancer have a higher risk of anal cancer. HIV infectionAIDS Being infected with human immunodeficiency virus HIV is a strong risk factor for anal cancer. HIV is the cause of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome AIDS. HIV weakens the body is immune system and its ability to fight infection. HPV infection of the anus is common among patients who are HIV-positive. The risk of anal cancer is higher in men who are HIV-positive and have sex with men compared with men who are HIV-negative and have sex with men. Women who are HIV-positive also have an increased risk of anal cancer compared with women who are HIV-negative. Studies show that intravenous drug use or cigarette smoking may further increase the risk of anal cancer in patients who are HIV-positive. Immunosuppression Immunosuppression is a condition that weakens the body is immune system and its ability to fight infections and other diseases. Chronic long-term immunosuppression may increase the risk of anal cancer because it lowers the body is ability to fight HPV infection. Patients who have an organ transplant and receive immunosuppressive medicine to prevent organ rejection have an increased risk of anal cancer. Having an autoimmune disorder such as Crohn disease or psoriasis may increase the risk of anal cancer. It is not clear if the increased risk is due to the autoimmune condition the treatment for the condition or a combination of both. Certain sexual practices The following sexual practices increase the risk of anal cancer because they increase the chance of being infected with HPV - Having receptive anal intercourse anal sex. - Having many sexual partners. - Sex between men. Men and women who have a history of anal warts or other sexually transmitted diseases also have an increased risk of anal cancer. Cigarette smoking Studies show that cigarette smoking increases the risk of anal cancer. Studies also show that current smokers have a higher risk of anal cancer than smokers who have quit or people who have never smoked. The following protective factor decreases the risk of anal cancer HPV vaccine The human papillomavirus HPV vaccine is used to prevent anal cancer cervical cancer vulvar cancer and vaginal cancer caused by HPV. It is also used to prevent lesions caused by HPV that may become cancer in the future. Studies show that being vaccinated against HPV lowers the risk of anal cancer. The vaccine may work best when it is given before a person is exposed to HPV. It is not clear if the following protective factor decreases the risk of anal cancer Condom use It is not known if the use of condoms protects against anal HPV infection. This is because not enough studies have been done to prove this. Cancer prevention clinical trials are used to study ways to prevent cancer. Cancer prevention clinical trials are used to study ways to lower the risk of developing certain types of cancer. Some cancer prevention trials are conducted with healthy people who have not had cancer but who have an increased risk for cancer. Other prevention trials are conducted with people who have had cancer and are trying to prevent another cancer of the same type or to lower their chance of developing a new type of cancer. Other trials are done with healthy volunteers who are not known to have any risk factors for cancer. The purpose of some cancer prevention clinical trials is to find out whether actions people take can prevent cancer.

Avoiding risk factors and increasing protective factors may help prevent lung cancer. Avoiding cancer risk factors may help prevent certain cancers. Risk factors include smoking being overweight and not getting enough exercise. Increasing protective factors such as quitting smoking and exercising may also help prevent some cancers. Talk to your doctor or other health care professional about how you might lower your risk of cancer. The following are risk factors for lung cancer Cigarette cigar and pipe smoking Tobacco smoking is the most important risk factor for lung cancer. Cigarette cigar and pipe smoking all increase the risk of lung cancer. Tobacco smoking causes about 9 out of 10 cases of lung cancer in men and about 8 out of 10 cases of lung cancer in women. Studies have shown that smoking low tar or low nicotine cigarettes does not lower the risk of lung cancer. Studies also show that the risk of lung cancer from smoking cigarettes increases with the number of cigarettes smoked per day and the number of years smoked. People who smoke have about 20 times the risk of lung cancer compared to those who do not smoke. Secondhand smoke Being exposed to secondhand tobacco smoke is also a risk factor for lung cancer. Secondhand smoke is the smoke that comes from a burning cigarette or other tobacco product or that is exhaled by smokers. People who inhale secondhand smoke are exposed to the same cancer -causing agents as smokers although in smaller amounts. Inhaling secondhand smoke is called involuntary or passive smoking. Family history Having a family history of lung cancer is a risk factor for lung cancer. People with a relative who has had lung cancer may be twice as likely to have lung cancer as people who do not have a relative who has had lung cancer. Because cigarette smoking tends to run in families and family members are exposed to secondhand smoke it is hard to know whether the increased risk of lung cancer is from the family history of lung cancer or from being exposed to cigarette smoke. HIV infection Being infected with the human immunodeficiency virus HIV the cause of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome AIDS is linked with a higher risk of lung cancer. People infected with HIV may have more than twice the risk of lung cancer than those who are not infected. Since smoking rates are higher in those infected with HIV than in those not infected it is not clear whether the increased risk of lung cancer is from HIV infection or from being exposed to cigarette smoke. Environmental risk factors - Radiation exposure Being exposed to radiation is a risk factor for lung cancer. Atomic bomb radiation radiation therapy imaging tests and radon are sources of radiation exposure - Atomic bomb radiation Being exposed to radiation after an atomic bomb explosion increases the risk of lung cancer. - Radiation therapy Radiation therapy to the chest may be used to treat certain cancers including breast cancer and Hodgkin lymphoma. Radiation therapy uses x-rays gamma rays or other types of radiation that may increase the risk of lung cancer. The higher the dose of radiation received the higher the risk. The risk of lung cancer following radiation therapy is higher in patients who smoke than in nonsmokers. - Imaging tests Imaging tests such as CT scans expose patients to radiation. Low-dose spiral CT scans expose patients to less radiation than higher dose CT scans. In lung cancer screening the use of low-dose spiral CT scans can lessen the harmful effects of radiation. - Radon Radon is a radioactive gas that comes from the breakdown of uranium in rocks and soil. It seeps up through the ground and leaks into the air or water supply. Radon can enter homes through cracks in floors walls or the foundation and levels of radon can build up over time. Studies show that high levels of radon gas inside the home or workplace increase the number of new cases of lung cancer and the number of deaths caused by lung cancer. The risk of lung cancer is higher in smokers exposed to radon than in nonsmokers who are exposed to it. In people who have never smoked about 30 of deaths caused by lung cancer have been linked to being exposed to radon. - Workplace exposure Studies show that being exposed to the following substances increases the risk of lung cancer - Asbestos. - Arsenic. - Chromium. - Nickel. - Beryllium. - Cadmium. - Tar and soot. These substances can cause lung cancer in people who are exposed to them in the workplace and have never smoked. As the level of exposure to these substances increases the risk of lung cancer also increases. The risk of lung cancer is even higher in people who are exposed and also smoke. - Air pollution Studies show that living in areas with higher levels of air pollution increases the risk of lung cancer. Beta carotene supplements in heavy smokers Taking beta carotene supplements pills increases the risk of lung cancer especially in smokers who smoke one or more packs a day. The risk is higher in smokers who have at least one alcoholic drink every day. The following are protective factors for lung cancer Not smoking The best way to prevent lung cancer is to not smoke. Quitting smoking Smokers can decrease their risk of lung cancer by quitting. In smokers who have been treated for lung cancer quitting smoking lowers the risk of new lung cancers. Counseling the use of nicotine replacement products and antidepressant therapy have helped smokers quit for good. In a person who has quit smoking the chance of preventing lung cancer depends on how many years and how much the person smoked and the length of time since quitting. After a person has quit smoking for 10 years the risk of lung cancer decreases 30 to 50. See the following for more information on quitting smoking - Tobacco includes help with quitting - Cigarette Smoking Health Risks and How to Quit Lower exposure to workplace risk factors Laws that protect workers from being exposed to cancer-causing substances such as asbestos arsenic nickel and chromium may help lower their risk of developing lung cancer. Laws that prevent smoking in the workplace help lower the risk of lung cancer caused by secondhand smoke. Lower exposure to radon Lowering radon levels may lower the risk of lung cancer especially among cigarette smokers. High levels of radon in homes may be reduced by taking steps to prevent radon leakage such as sealing basements. It is not clear if the following decrease the risk of lung cancer Diet Some studies show that people who eat high amounts of fruits or vegetables have a lower risk of lung cancer than those who eat low amounts. However since smokers tend to have less healthy diets than nonsmokers it is hard to know whether the decreased risk is from having a healthy diet or from not smoking. Physical activity Some studies show that people who are physically active have a lower risk of lung cancer than people who are not. However since smokers tend to have different levels of physical activity than nonsmokers it is hard to know if physical activity affects the risk of lung cancer. The following do not decrease the risk of lung cancer Beta carotene supplements in nonsmokers Studies of nonsmokers show that taking beta carotene supplements does not lower their risk of lung cancer. Vitamin E supplements Studies show that taking vitamin E supplements does not affect the risk of lung cancer. Cancer prevention clinical trials are used to study ways to prevent cancer. Cancer prevention clinical trials are used to study ways to lower the risk of developing certain types of cancer. Some cancer prevention trials are conducted with healthy people who have not had cancer but who have an increased risk for cancer. Other prevention trials are conducted with people who have had cancer and are trying to prevent another cancer of the same type or to lower their chance of developing a new type of cancer. Other trials are done with healthy volunteers who are not known to have any risk factors for cancer. The purpose of some cancer prevention clinical trials is to find out whether actions people take can prevent cancer. These may include eating fruits and vegetables exercising quitting smoking or taking certain medicines vitamins minerals or food supplements. New ways to prevent lung cancer are being studied in clinical trials. Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country.

        "instruction": "What is are autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome ",
        "output": "Autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome ALPS is an inherited disorder in which the body cannot properly regulate the number of immune system cells lymphocytes. ALPS is characterized by the production of an abnormally large number of lymphocytes lymphoproliferation. Accumulation of excess lymphocytes results in enlargement of the lymph nodes lymphadenopathy the liver hepatomegaly and the spleen splenomegaly. People with ALPS have an increased risk of developing cancer of the immune system cells lymphoma and may also be at increased risk of developing other cancers. Autoimmune disorders are also common in ALPS. Autoimmune disorders occur when the immune system malfunctions and attacks the body is own tissues and organs. Most of the autoimmune disorders associated with ALPS target and damage blood cells. For example the immune system may attack red blood cells autoimmune hemolytic anemia white blood cells autoimmune neutropenia or platelets autoimmune thrombocytopenia. Less commonly autoimmune disorders that affect other organs and tissues occur in people with ALPS. These disorders can damage the kidneys glomerulonephritis liver autoimmune hepatitis eyes uveitis nerves Guillain-Barre syndrome or the connective tissues systemic lupus erythematosus that provide strength and flexibility to structures throughout the body. Skin problems usually rashes or hives urticaria can occur in ALPS. Occasionally affected individuals develop hardened skin with painful lumps or patches panniculitis. Other rare signs and symptoms of ALPS include joint inflammation arthritis inflammation of blood vessels vasculitis mouth sores oral ulcers or an early loss of ovarian function premature ovarian failure may also occur in this disorder. Affected individuals can also develop neurological damage organic brain syndrome with symptoms that may include headaches seizures or a decline in intellectual functions dementia. ALPS can have different patterns of signs and symptoms which are sometimes considered separate forms of the disorder. In the most common form lymphoproliferation generally becomes apparent during childhood. Enlargement of the lymph nodes and spleen frequently occur in affected individuals. Autoimmune disorders typically develop several years later most frequently as a combination of hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia also called Evans syndrome. People with this classic form of ALPS have a greatly increased risk of developing lymphoma compared with the general population. Other types of ALPS are very rare. In some affected individuals severe lymphoproliferation begins around the time of birth and autoimmune disorders and lymphoma develop at an early age. People with this pattern of signs and symptoms generally do not live beyond childhood. Another form of ALPS involves lymphoproliferation and the tendency to develop systemic lupus erythematosus. Individuals with this form of the disorder do not have an enlarged spleen. Some people have signs and symptoms that resemble those of ALPS but the specific pattern of these signs and symptoms or the genetic cause may be different than in other forms. Researchers disagree whether individuals with these non-classic forms should be considered to have ALPS or a separate condition."

        "output": "Autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy ADNFLE is an uncommon form of epilepsy that runs in families. This disorder causes seizures that usually occur at night nocturnally while an affected person is sleeping. Some people with ADNFLE also have seizures during the day. The seizures characteristic of ADNFLE tend to occur in clusters with each one lasting from a few seconds to a few minutes. Some people have mild seizures that simply cause them to wake up from sleep. Others have more severe episodes that can include sudden repetitive movements such as flinging or throwing motions of the arms and bicycling movements of the legs. The person may get out of bed and wander around which can be mistaken for sleepwalking. The person may also cry out or make moaning gasping or grunting sounds. These episodes are sometimes misdiagnosed as nightmares night terrors or panic attacks. In some types of epilepsy including ADNFLE a pattern of neurological symptoms called an aura often precedes a seizure. The most common symptoms associated with an aura in people with ADNFLE are tingling shivering a sense of fear dizziness vertigo and a feeling of falling or being pushed. Some affected people have also reported a feeling of breathlessness overly fast breathing hyperventilation or choking. It is unclear what brings on seizures in people with ADNFLE. Episodes may be triggered by stress or fatigue but in most cases the seizures do not have any recognized triggers. The seizures associated with ADNFLE can begin anytime from infancy to mid-adulthood but most begin in childhood. The episodes tend to become milder and less frequent with age. In most affected people the seizures can be effectively controlled with medication. Most people with ADNFLE are intellectually normal and there are no problems with their brain function between seizures. However some people with ADNFLE have experienced psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia behavioral problems or intellectual disability. It is unclear whether these additional features are directly related to epilepsy in these individuals."

        "output": "Cold-induced sweating syndrome is characterized by problems with regulating body temperature and other abnormalities affecting many parts of the body. In infancy the features of this condition are often known as Crisponi syndrome. Researchers originally thought that cold-induced sweating syndrome and Crisponi syndrome were separate disorders but it is now widely believed that they represent the same condition at different times during life. Infants with Crisponi syndrome have unusual facial features including a flat nasal bridge upturned nostrils a long space between the nose and upper lip philtrum a high arched roof of the mouth palate a small chin micrognathia and low-set ears. The muscles in the lower part of the face are weak leading to severe feeding difficulties excessive drooling and breathing problems. Other physical abnormalities associated with Crisponi syndrome include a scaly skin rash an inability to fully extend the elbows overlapping fingers and tightly fisted hands and malformations of the feet and toes. Affected infants startle easily and often tense their facial muscles into a grimace-like expression. By six months of age infants with Crisponi syndrome develop unexplained high fevers that increase the risk of seizures and sudden death. Many of the health problems associated with Crisponi syndrome improve with time and affected individuals who survive the newborn period go on to develop other features of cold-induced sweating syndrome in early childhood. Within the first decade of life affected individuals begin having episodes of profuse sweating hyperhidrosis and shivering involving the face torso and arms. The excessive sweating is usually triggered by exposure to temperatures below about 65 or 70 degrees Fahrenheit but it can also be triggered by nervousness or eating sugary foods. Paradoxically affected individuals tend not to sweat in warmer conditions instead becoming flushed and overheated in hot environments. Adolescents with cold-induced sweating syndrome typically develop abnormal side-to-side and front-to-back curvature of the spine scoliosis and kyphosis often called kyphoscoliosis when they occur together. Although infants may develop life-threatening fevers affected individuals who survive infancy have a normal life expectancy."

        "output": "Each form of porphyria results from mutations in one of these genes ALAD ALAS2 CPOX FECH HMBS PPOX UROD or UROS. The genes related to porphyria provide instructions for making the enzymes needed to produce heme. Mutations in most of these genes reduce enzyme activity which limits the amount of heme the body can produce. As a result compounds called porphyrins and porphyrin precursors which are formed during the process of heme production can build up abnormally in the liver and other organs. When these substances accumulate in the skin and interact with sunlight they cause the cutaneous forms of porphyria. The acute forms of the disease occur when porphyrins and porphyrin precursors build up in and damage the nervous system. One type of porphyria porphyria cutanea tarda results from both genetic and nongenetic factors. About 20 percent of cases are related to mutations in the UROD gene. The remaining cases are not associated with UROD gene mutations and are classified as sporadic. Many factors contribute to the development of porphyria cutanea tarda. These include an increased amount of iron in the liver alcohol consumption smoking hepatitis C or HIV infection or certain hormones. Mutations in the HFE gene which cause an iron overload disorder called hemochromatosis are also associated with porphyria cutanea tarda. Other as-yet-unidentified genetic factors may also play a role in this form of porphyria."

        "output": "Mutations in the BMPR2 gene are the most common genetic cause of pulmonary arterial hypertension. This gene plays a role in regulating the number of cells in certain tissues. Researchers suggest that a mutation in this gene promotes cell division or prevents cell death resulting in an overgrowth of cells in small arteries throughout the lungs. As a result these arteries narrow in diameter which increases the resistance to blood flow. Blood pressure in the pulmonary artery and the right ventricle of the heart increases to overcome the increased resistance to blood flow. Mutations in several additional genes have also been found to cause pulmonary arterial hypertension but they are much less common causes of the disorder than are BMPR2 gene mutations. Variations in other genes may increase the risk of developing pulmonary arterial hypertension or modify the course of the disease usually making it more severe. Changes in as-yet-unidentified genes may also be associated with this condition. Although pulmonary arterial hypertension often occurs on its own it can also be part of syndromes that affect many parts of the body. For example this condition is occasionally found in people with systemic scleroderma systemic lupus erythematosus critical congenital heart disease or Down syndrome. Researchers have also identified nongenetic factors that increase the risk of developing pulmonary arterial hypertension. These include certain drugs used as appetite suppressants and several illegal drugs such as cocaine and methamphetamine. Pulmonary arterial hypertension is also a rare complication of certain infectious diseases including HIV and schistosomiasis."

        "instruction": "What are the genetic changes related to small fiber neuropathy ",
        "output": "Mutations in the SCN9A or SCN10A gene can cause small fiber neuropathy. These genes provide instructions for making pieces the alpha subunits of sodium channels. The SCN9A gene instructs the production of the alpha subunit for the NaV1.7 sodium channel and the SCN10A gene instructs the production of the alpha subunit for the NaV1.8 sodium channel. Sodium channels transport positively charged sodium atoms sodium ions into cells and play a key role in a cell is ability to generate and transmit electrical signals. The NaV1.7 and NaV1.8 sodium channels are found in nerve cells called nociceptors that transmit pain signals to the spinal cord and brain. The SCN9A gene mutations that cause small fiber neuropathy result in NaV1.7 sodium channels that do not close completely when the channel is turned off. Many SCN10A gene mutations result in NaV1.8 sodium channels that open more easily than usual. The altered channels allow sodium ions to flow abnormally into nociceptors. This increase in sodium ions enhances transmission of pain signals causing individuals to be more sensitive to stimulation that might otherwise not cause pain. In this condition the small fibers that extend from the nociceptors through which pain signals are transmitted axons degenerate over time. The cause of this degeneration is unknown but it likely accounts for signs and symptoms such as the loss of temperature differentiation and pinprick sensation. The combination of increased pain signaling and degeneration of pain-transmitting fibers leads to a variable condition with signs and symptoms that can change over time. SCN9A gene mutations have been found in approximately 30 percent of individuals with small fiber neuropathy SCN10A gene mutations are responsible for about 5 percent of cases. In some instances other health conditions cause this disorder. Diabetes mellitus and impaired glucose tolerance are the most common diseases that lead to this disorder with 6 to 50 percent of diabetics or pre-diabetics developing small fiber neuropathy. Other causes of this condition include a metabolic disorder called Fabry disease immune disorders such as celiac disease or Sjogren syndrome an inflammatory condition called sarcoidosis and human immunodeficiency virus HIV infection."

        "instruction": "What are the genetic changes related to Stevens-Johnson syndrometoxic epidermal necrolysis ",
        "output": "Several genetic changes have been found to increase the risk of SJSTEN in response to triggering factors such as medications. Most of these changes occur in genes that are involved in the normal function of the immune system. The genetic variations most strongly associated with SJSTEN occur in the HLA-B gene. This gene is part of a family of genes called the human leukocyte antigen HLA complex. The HLA complex helps the immune system distinguish the body is own proteins from proteins made by foreign invaders such as viruses and bacteria. The HLA-B gene has many different normal variations allowing each person is immune system to react to a wide range of foreign proteins. Certain variations in this gene occur much more often in people with SJSTEN than in people without the condition. Studies suggest that the HLA-B gene variations associated with SJSTEN cause the immune system to react abnormally to certain medications. In a process that is not well understood the drug causes immune cells called cytotoxic T cells and natural killer NK cells to release a substance called granulysin that destroys cells in the skin and mucous membranes. The death of these cells causes the blistering and peeling that is characteristic of SJSTEN. Variations in several other HLA and non-HLA genes have also been studied as potential risk factors for SJSTEN. However most people with genetic variations that increase the risk of SJSTEN never develop the disease even if they are exposed to drugs that can trigger it. Researchers believe that additional genetic and nongenetic factors many of which are unknown likely play a role in whether a particular individual develops SJSTEN. The drugs most frequently associated with SJSTEN include several medications that are used to treat seizures particularly carbamazepine lamotrigine and phenytoin allopurinol which is used to treat kidney stones and a form of arthritis called gout a class of antibiotic drugs called sulfonamides nevirapine which is used to treat HIV infection and a type of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs NSAIDs called oxicams. Other factors may also trigger SJSTEN. In particular these skin reactions have occurred in people with an unusual form of pneumonia caused by infection with Mycoplasma pneumoniae and in people with viral infections including cytomegalovirus. Researchers suspect that a combination of infections and drugs could contribute to the disease in some individuals. In many cases no definitive trigger for an individual is SJSTEN is ever discovered."

Autoimmune Disorders Up to 80 percent of Addisons disease cases are caused by an autoimmune disorder which is when the bodys immune system attacks the bodys own cells and organs.2 In autoimmune Addisons which mainly occurs in middle-aged females the immune system gradually destroys the adrenal cortexthe outer layer of the adrenal glands.2 Primary adrenal insufficiency occurs when at least 90 percent of the adrenal cortex has been destroyed.1 As a result both cortisol and aldosterone are often lacking. Sometimes only the adrenal glands are affected. Sometimes other endocrine glands are affected as well as in polyendocrine deficiency syndrome. Polyendocrine deficiency syndrome is classified into type 1 and type 2. Type 1 is inherited and occurs in children. In addition to adrenal insufficiency these children may have - underactive parathyroid glands which are four pea-sized glands located on or near the thyroid gland in the neck they produce a hormone that helps maintain the correct balance of calcium in the body. - slow sexual development. - pernicious anemia a severe type of anemia anemia is a condition in which red blood cells are fewer than normal which means less oxygen is carried to the bodys cells. With most types of anemia red blood cells are smaller than normal however in pernicious anemia the cells are bigger than normal. - chronic fungal infections. - chronic hepatitis a liver disease. Researchers think type 2 which is sometimes called Schmidts syndrome is also inherited. Type 2 usually affects young adults and may include - an underactive thyroid gland which produces hormones that regulate metabolism - slow sexual development - diabetes in which a person has high blood glucose also called high blood sugar or hyperglycemia - vitiligo a loss of pigment on areas of the skin Infections Tuberculosis TB an infection that can destroy the adrenal glands accounts for 10 to 15 percent of Addisons disease cases in developed countries.1 When primary adrenal insufficiency was first identified by Dr. Thomas Addison in 1849 TB was the most common cause of the disease. As TB treatment improved the incidence of Addisons disease due to TB of the adrenal glands greatly decreased. However recent reports show an increase in Addisons disease from infections such as TB and cytomegalovirus. Cytomegalovirus is a common virus that does not cause symptoms in healthy people however it does affect babies in the womb and people who have a weakened immune systemmostly due to HIVAIDS.2 Other bacterial infections such as Neisseria meningitidis which is a cause of meningitis and fungal infections can also lead to Addisons disease. Other Causes Less common causes of Addisons disease are - cancer cells in the adrenal glands - amyloidosis a serious though rare group of diseases that occurs when abnormal proteins called amyloids build up in the blood and are deposited in tissues and organs - surgical removal of the adrenal glands - bleeding into the adrenal glands - genetic defects including abnormal adrenal gland development an inability of the adrenal glands to respond to ACTH or a defect in adrenal hormone production - medication-related causes such as from anti-fungal medications and the anesthetic etomidate which may be used when a person undergoes an emergency intubationthe placement of a flexible plastic tube through the mouth and into the trachea or windpipe to assist with breathing 2"

Individuals who consume products made from cattle infected with the agent that causes mad cow disease can become infected with the agent themselves and develop the human form of mad cow disease called variant CJD vCJD. In humans vCJD and the more common forms of CJD those without the word variant are separate diseases. As of November 2012 227 cases of vCJD were confirmed worldwide mostly from the United Kingdom. Researchers believe all but three of these 227 individuals got vCJD by eating beef from animals with mad cow disease. The three exceptions were persons who are believed to have developed vCJD because they received infected blood from a donor who had acquired the agent by eating beef from animals with mad cow disease. In the United States three cases of vCJD have been found. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC the investigation of these three cases indicated that they most likely acquired their infection in the United Kingdom two cases and Saudi Arabia one case. People who received pituitary hGH are not at higher risk for vCJD. AIDS HIV also known as the human immunodeficiency virus causes AIDS. Pituitary hGH does not cause AIDS. HIV is destroyed by the methods used to make pituitary hGH. People who have been treated with pituitary hGH do not have a higher risk for AIDS. Low Levels of GH in Adults Some people who received pituitary hGH as children may have low levels of GH as adults and might therefore benefit from bGH as adults. People with low levels of growth hormone as adults may have symptoms or changes like these - more body fat - less muscle - less bone mass - less strength - less energy If you lacked GH as a child and have these problems as an adult ask your doctor whether they might be due to low GH. Because these conditions are common in many people they are not always due to low GH. Studies have shown that GH treatment in adults with low GH reduces fat and increases muscle mass. Effects on strength energy and bone fractures in GH-deficient adults receiving GH replacement are not as clear. Today GH is completely synthetic. It is not made from human pituitaries. It poses no threat of contamination. The Human Growth Foundation HGF is one source of information about growth-related disorders. The Foundation can be reached at 18004516434. Cancer HHS studies of people treated with pituitary hGH supplied by the NHPP show no increased risk of cancer in those who did not have tumors before pituitary hGH treatment. Many people who received NHPP pituitary hGH had brain tumors that caused their lack of GH. People who have had one tumor have an increased risk for getting other tumors. In previous updates we reported that in 1988 Japanese doctors reported an increased risk of leukemia in people treated with GH. Subsequent studies of individuals who were given pituitary hGH in the United States Japan and the United Kingdom found no higher rate of leukemia among those who did not have tumors andor radiation before treatment with pituitary hGH. Emotional Problems No studies have shown that pituitary hGH causes changes in personality emotional problems or suicide."

        "instruction": "What causes Anemia of Inflammation and Chronic Disease ",
        "output": "Anemia of inflammation and chronic disease is caused by red blood cells not functioning normally so they cannot absorb and use iron efficiently. In addition the body cannot respond normally to erythropoietin EPO a hormone made by the kidneys that stimulates bone marrow to produce red blood cells. Over time this abnormal functioning causes a lower than normal number of red blood cells in the body. Some of the chronic diseases that lead to AIACD include infectious and inflammatory diseases kidney disease and cancer. Certain treatments for chronic diseases may also impair red blood cell production and contribute to AIACD. Infectious and inflammatory diseases. As part of the immune system response that occurs with infectious and inflammatory diseases cells of the immune system release proteins called cytokines. Cytokines help heal the body and defend it against infection. However they can also affect normal body functions. In AIACD immune cytokines interfere with the bodys ability to absorb and use iron. Cytokines may also interfere with the production and normal activity of EPO. Infectious diseases that cause AIACD include - tuberculosis an infection in the lungs - HIVAIDS an infection that destroys the immune system - endocarditis an infection in the heart - osteomyelitis a bone infection Sometimes acute infectionsthose that develop quickly and may not last longcan also cause AIACD. Inflammatory diseases that can lead to AIACD include - rheumatoid arthritis which causes pain swelling stiffness and loss of function in the joints - lupus which causes damage to various body tissues such as the joints skin kidneys heart lungs blood vessels and brain - diabetes in which levels of blood glucose also called blood sugar are above normal - heart failure in which the heart cannot pump enough blood to meet the bodys needs - inflammatory bowel disease IBD diseases that cause inflammation and irritation in the intestines IBD including Crohns disease can also cause iron deficiency due to poor absorption of iron by the diseased intestine and bleeding from the gastrointestinal GI tract. Kidney disease. People with kidney disease can develop anemia for several different reasons. Diseased kidneys often fail to make enough EPO. In addition kidney disease results in abnormal absorption and use of iron which is typical of AIACD. Anemia worsens as kidney disease advances. Therefore most people with kidney failure have anemia. Kidney failure is described as end-stage kidney disease sometimes called ESRD when treated with a kidney transplant or blood-filtering treatments called dialysis. People with kidney failure can also develop iron deficiency due to blood loss during hemodialysis a type of dialysis that uses a special filter called a dialyzer to remove wastes from the blood. Low levels of iron and folic acidanother nutrient required for normal red blood cell productionmay also contribute to anemia in people with kidney disease. Cancer. AIACD can occur with certain types of cancer including Hodgkins disease non-Hodgkins lymphoma and breast cancer. Like infectious and inflammatory diseases these types of cancer cause inflammatory cytokines to be released in the body. Anemia can also be made worse by chemotherapy and radiation treatments that damage the bone marrow and by the cancers invasion of bone marrow."

        "instruction": "What causes Causes of Diabetes ",
        "output": "Other types of diabetes have a variety of possible causes. Genetic Mutations Affecting Beta Cells Insulin and Insulin Action Some relatively uncommon forms of diabetes known as monogenic diabetes are caused by mutations or changes in a single gene. These mutations are usually inherited but sometimes the gene mutation occurs spontaneously. Most of these gene mutations cause diabetes by reducing beta cells ability to produce insulin. The most common types of monogenic diabetes are neonatal diabetes mellitus NDM and MODY. NDM occurs in the first 6 months of life. MODY is usually found during adolescence or early adulthood but sometimes is not diagnosed until later in life. More information about NDM and MODY is provided in the NIDDK health topic Monogenic Forms of Diabetes. Other rare genetic mutations can cause diabetes by damaging the quality of insulin the body produces or by causing abnormalities in insulin receptors. Other Genetic Diseases Diabetes occurs in people with Down syndrome Klinefelter syndrome and Turner syndrome at higher rates than the general population. Scientists are investigating whether genes that may predispose people to genetic syndromes also predispose them to diabetes. The genetic disorders cystic fibrosis and hemochromatosis are linked to diabetes. Cystic fibrosis produces abnormally thick mucus which blocks the pancreas. The risk of diabetes increases with age in people with cystic fibrosis. Hemochromatosis causes the body to store too much iron. If the disorder is not treated iron can build up in and damage the pancreas and other organs. Damage to or Removal of the Pancreas Pancreatitis cancer and trauma can all harm the pancreatic beta cells or impair insulin production thus causing diabetes. If the damaged pancreas is removed diabetes will occur due to the loss of the beta cells. Endocrine Diseases Endocrine diseases affect organs that produce hormones. Cushings syndrome and acromegaly are examples of hormonal disorders that can cause prediabetes and diabetes by inducing insulin resistance. Cushings syndrome is marked by excessive production of cortisolsometimes called the stress hormone. Acromegaly occurs when the body produces too much growth hormone. Glucagonoma a rare tumor of the pancreas can also cause diabetes. The tumor causes the body to produce too much glucagon. Hyperthyroidism a disorder that occurs when the thyroid gland produces too much thyroid hormone can also cause elevated blood glucose levels. Autoimmune Disorders Rare disorders characterized by antibodies that disrupt insulin action can lead to diabetes. This kind of diabetes is often associated with other autoimmune disorders such as lupus erythematosus. Another rare autoimmune disorder called stiff-man syndrome is associated with antibodies that attack the beta cells similar to type 1 diabetes. Medications and Chemical Toxins Some medications such as nicotinic acid and certain types of diuretics anti-seizure drugs psychiatric drugs and drugs to treat human immunodeficiency virus HIV can impair beta cells or disrupt insulin action. Pentamidine a drug prescribed to treat a type of pneumonia can increase the risk of pancreatitis beta cell damage and diabetes. Also glucocorticoidssteroid hormones that are chemically similar to naturally produced cortisolmay impair insulin action. Glucocorticoids are used to treat inflammatory illnesses such as rheumatoid arthritis asthma lupus and ulcerative colitis. Many chemical toxins can damage or destroy beta cells in animals but only a few have been linked to diabetes in humans. For example dioxina contaminant of the herbicide Agent Orange used during the Vietnam Warmay be linked to the development of type 2 diabetes. In 2000 based on a report from the Institute of Medicine the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs VA added diabetes to the list of conditions for which Vietnam veterans are eligible for disability compensation. Also a chemical in a rat poison no longer in use has been shown to cause diabetes if ingested. Some studies suggest a high intake of nitrogen-containing chemicals such as nitrates and nitrites might increase the risk of diabetes. Arsenic has also been studied for possible links to diabetes. Lipodystrophy Lipodystrophy is a condition in which fat tissue is lost or redistributed in the body. The condition is associated with insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes."

Cushings syndrome is marked by excessive production of cortisolsometimes called the stress hormone. Acromegaly occurs when the body produces too much growth hormone. Glucagonoma a rare tumor of the pancreas can also cause diabetes. The tumor causes the body to produce too much glucagon. Hyperthyroidism a disorder that occurs when the thyroid gland produces too much thyroid hormone can also cause elevated blood glucose levels. Autoimmune Disorders Rare disorders characterized by antibodies that disrupt insulin action can lead to diabetes. This kind of diabetes is often associated with other autoimmune disorders such as lupus erythematosus. Another rare autoimmune disorder called stiff-man syndrome is associated with antibodies that attack the beta cells similar to type 1 diabetes. Medications and Chemical Toxins Some medications such as nicotinic acid and certain types of diuretics anti-seizure drugs psychiatric drugs and drugs to treat human immunodeficiency virus HIV can impair beta cells or disrupt insulin action. Pentamidine a drug prescribed to treat a type of pneumonia can increase the risk of pancreatitis beta cell damage and diabetes. Also glucocorticoidssteroid hormones that are chemically similar to naturally produced cortisolmay impair insulin action. Glucocorticoids are used to treat inflammatory illnesses such as rheumatoid arthritis asthma lupus and ulcerative colitis. Many chemical toxins can damage or destroy beta cells in animals but only a few have been linked to diabetes in humans. For example dioxina contaminant of the herbicide Agent Orange used during the Vietnam Warmay be linked to the development of type 2 diabetes. In 2000 based on a report from the Institute of Medicine the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs VA added diabetes to the list of conditions for which Vietnam veterans are eligible for disability compensation. Also a chemical in a rat poison no longer in use has been shown to cause diabetes if ingested. Some studies suggest a high intake of nitrogen-containing chemicals such as nitrates and nitrites might increase the risk of diabetes. Arsenic has also been studied for possible links to diabetes. Lipodystrophy Lipodystrophy is a condition in which fat tissue is lost or redistributed in the body. The condition is associated with insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes."

        "output": "While idiopathic or unknown diseases are the most common cause of primary childhood nephrotic syndrome researchers have linked certain diseases and some specific genetic changes that damage the kidneys with primary childhood nephrotic syndrome. The cause of secondary childhood nephrotic syndrome is an underlying disease or infection. Called a primary illness its this underlying disease or infection that causes changes in the kidney function that can result in secondary childhood nephrotic syndrome. Congenital diseasesdiseases that are present at birthcan also cause childhood nephrotic syndrome. Primary Childhood Nephrotic Syndrome The following diseases are different types of idiopathic childhood nephrotic syndrome - Minimal change disease involves damage to the glomeruli that can be seen only with an electron microscope. This type of microscope shows tiny details better than any other microscope. Scientists do not know the exact cause of minimal change disease. Minimal change disease is the most common cause of idiopathic childhood nephrotic syndrome.1 - Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis is scarring in scattered regions of the kidney - Focal means that only some of the glomeruli become scarred. - Segmental means damage affects only part of an individual glomerulus. - Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis is a group of disorders involving deposits of antibodies that build up in the glomeruli causing thickening and damage. Antibodies are proteins made by the immune system to protect the body from foreign substances such as bacteria or viruses. Secondary Childhood Nephrotic Syndrome Some common diseases that can cause secondary childhood nephrotic syndrome include - diabetes a condition that occurs when the body cannot use glucosea type of sugarnormally - Henoch-Schnlein purpura a disease that causes small blood vessels in the body to become inflamed and leak - hepatitis inflammation of the liver caused by a virus - human immunodeficiency virus HIV a virus that alters the immune system - lupus an autoimmune disease that occurs when the body attacks its own immune system - malaria a disease of the blood that is spread by mosquitos - streptococcal infection an infection that results when the bacteria that causes strep throat or a skin infection is left untreated Other causes of secondary childhood nephrotic syndrome can include certain medications such as aspirin ibuprofen or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and exposure to chemicals such as mercury and lithium. Congenital Diseases and Childhood Nephrotic Syndrome Congenital nephrotic syndrome is rare and affects infants in the first 3 months of life.2 This type of nephrotic syndrome sometimes called infantile nephrotic syndrome can be caused by - inherited genetic defects which are problems passed from parent to child through genes - infections at the time of birth More information about underlying diseases or infections that cause changes in kidney function is provided in the NIDDK health topic Glomerular Diseases."

        "instruction": "What are the treatments for Childhood Nephrotic Syndrome ",
        "output": "Health care providers will decide how to treat childhood nephrotic syndrome based on the type - primary childhood nephrotic syndrome medications - secondary childhood nephrotic syndrome treat the underlying illness or disease - congenital nephrotic syndrome medications surgery to remove one or both kidneys and transplantation Primary Childhood Nephrotic Syndrome Health care providers treat idiopathic childhood nephrotic syndrome with several types of medications that control the immune system remove extra fluid and lower blood pressure. - Control the immune system. Corticosteroids are a group of medications that reduce the activity of the immune system decrease the amount of albumin lost in the urine and decrease swelling. Health care providers commonly use prednisone or a related corticosteroid to treat idiopathic childhood nephrotic syndrome. About 90 percent of children achieve remission with daily corticosteroids for 6 weeks and then a slightly smaller dose every other day for 6 weeks.2 Remission is a period when the child is symptom-free. Many children relapse after initial therapy and health care providers treat them with a shorter course of corticosteroids until the disease goes into remission again. Children may have multiple relapses however they most often recover without long-term kidney damage. When a child has frequent relapses or does not respond to treatment a health care provider may prescribe other medications that reduce the activity of the immune system. These medications prevent the body from making antibodies that can damage kidney tissues. They include - cyclophosphamide - mycophenolate CellCept Myfortic - cyclosporine - tacrolimus Hecoria Prograf A health care provider may use these other immune system medications with corticosteroids or in place of corticosteroids. - Remove extra fluid. A health care provider may prescribe a diuretic a medication that helps the kidneys remove extra fluid from the blood. Removing the extra fluid can often help to lower blood pressure. - Lower blood pressure. Some children with childhood nephrotic syndrome develop high blood pressure and may need to take additional medications to lower their blood pressure. Two types of blood pressure-lowering medications angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers have the additional benefit of slowing the progression of kidney disease. Many children with nephrotic syndrome require two or more medications to control their blood pressure. Secondary Childhood Nephrotic Syndrome Health care providers treat secondary childhood nephrotic syndrome by treating the underlying cause of the primary illness. For example a health care provider may treat children by - prescribing antibiotics for an infection - adjusting medications to treat lupus HIV or diabetes - changing or stopping medications that are known to cause secondary childhood nephrotic syndrome While treating the underlying cause the health care provider will also treat the child to improve or restore kidney function with the same medications used to treat primary childhood nephrotic syndrome. Caretakers should make sure that children take all prescribed medications and follow the treatment plan recommended by their health care provider. More information about specific treatments for secondary childhood nephrotic syndrome is provided in the NIDDK health topic Glomerular Diseases. Congenital Nephrotic Syndrome Researchers have found that medications are not effective in treating congenital nephrotic syndrome and that most children will need a kidney transplant by the time they are 2 or 3 years old. A kidney transplant is surgery to place a healthy kidney from someone who has just died or a living donor most often a family member into a persons body to take over the job of the failing kidney. To keep the child healthy until the transplant the health care provider may recommend the following - albumin injections to make up for the albumin lost in urine - diuretics to help remove extra fluid that causes swelling - antibiotics to treat the first signs of infection - growth hormones to promote growth and help bones mature - removal of one or both kidneys to decrease the loss of albumin in the urine - dialysis to artificially filter wastes from the blood if the kidneys fail More information is provided in the NIDDK health topic Treatment Methods for Kidney Failure in Children."

        "instruction": "What causes Glomerular Diseases ",
        "output": "A number of different diseases can result in glomerular disease. It may be the direct result of an infection or a drug toxic to the kidneys or it may result from a disease that affects the entire body like diabetes or lupus. Many different kinds of diseases can cause swelling or scarring of the nephron or glomerulus. Sometimes glomerular disease is idiopathic meaning that it occurs without an apparent associated disease. The categories presented below can overlap that is a disease might belong to two or more of the categories. For example diabetic nephropathy is a form of glomerular disease that can be placed in two categories systemic diseases since diabetes itself is a systemic disease and sclerotic diseases because the specific damage done to the kidneys is associated with scarring. Autoimmune Diseases When the body is immune system functions properly it creates protein-like substances called antibodies and immunoglobulins to protect the body against invading organisms. In an autoimmune disease the immune system creates autoantibodies which are antibodies or immunoglobulins that attack the body itself. Autoimmune diseases may be systemic and affect many parts of the body or they may affect only specific organs or regions. Systemic lupus erythematosus SLE affects many parts of the body primarily the skin and joints but also the kidneys. Because women are more likely to develop SLE than men some researchers believe that a sex-linked genetic factor may play a part in making a person susceptible although viral infection has also been implicated as a triggering factor. Lupus nephritis is the name given to the kidney disease caused by SLE and it occurs when autoantibodies form or are deposited in the glomeruli causing inflammation. Ultimately the inflammation may create scars that keep the kidneys from functioning properly. Conventional treatment for lupus nephritis includes a combination of two drugs cyclophosphamide a cytotoxic agent that suppresses the immune system and prednisolone a corticosteroid used to reduce inflammation. A newer immunosuppressant mychophenolate mofetil MMF has been used instead of cyclophosphamide. Preliminary studies indicate that MMF may be as effective as cyclophosphamide and has milder side effects. Goodpasture is Syndrome involves an autoantibody that specifically targets the kidneys and the lungs. Often the first indication that patients have the autoantibody is when they cough up blood. But lung damage in Goodpasture is Syndrome is usually superficial compared with progressive and permanent damage to the kidneys. Goodpasture is Syndrome is a rare condition that affects mostly young men but also occurs in women children and older adults. Treatments include immunosuppressive drugs and a blood-cleaning therapy called plasmapheresis that removes the autoantibodies. IgA nephropathy is a form of glomerular disease that results when immunoglobulin A IgA forms deposits in the glomeruli where it creates inflammation. IgA nephropathy was not recognized as a cause of glomerular disease until the late 1960s when sophisticated biopsy techniques were developed that could identify IgA deposits in kidney tissue. The most common symptom of IgA nephropathy is blood in the urine but it is often a silent disease that may go undetected for many years. The silent nature of the disease makes it difficult to determine how many people are in the early stages of IgA nephropathy when specific medical tests are the only way to detect it. This disease is estimated to be the most common cause of primary glomerulonephritisthat is glomerular disease not caused by a systemic disease like lupus or diabetes mellitus. It appears to affect men more than women. Although IgA nephropathy is found in all age groups young people rarely display signs of kidney failure because the disease usually takes several years to progress to the stage where it causes detectable complications. No treatment is recommended for early or mild cases of IgA nephropathy when the patient has normal blood pressure and less than 1 gram of protein in a 24-hour urine output. When proteinuria exceeds 1 gramday treatment is aimed at protecting kidney function by reducing proteinuria and controlling blood pressure. Blood pressure medicinesangiotensinconverting enzyme inhibitors ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers ARBsthat block a hormone called angiotensin are most effective at achieving those two goals simultaneously. Hereditary NephritisAlport Syndrome The primary indicator of Alport syndrome is a family history of chronic glomerular disease although it may also involve hearing or vision impairment. This syndrome affects both men and women but men are more likely to experience chronic kidney disease and sensory loss. Men with Alport syndrome usually first show evidence of renal insufficiency while in their twenties and reach total kidney failure by age 40. Women rarely have significant renal impairment and hearing loss may be so slight that it can be detected only through testing with special equipment. Usually men can pass the disease only to their daughters. Women can transmit the disease to either their sons or their daughters. Treatment focuses on controlling blood pressure to maintain kidney function. Infection-related Glomerular Disease Glomerular disease sometimes develops rapidly after an infection in other parts of the body. Acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis PSGN can occur after an episode of strep throat or in rare cases impetigo a skin infection. The Streptococcus bacteria do not attack the kidney directly but an infection may stimulate the immune system to overproduce antibodies which are circulated in the blood and finally deposited in the glomeruli causing damage. PSGN can bring on sudden symptoms of swelling edema reduced urine output oliguria and blood in the urine hematuria. Tests will show large amounts of protein in the urine and elevated levels of creatinine and urea nitrogen in the blood thus indicating reduced kidney function. High blood pressure frequently accompanies reduced kidney function in this disease. PSGN is most common in children between the ages of 3 and 7 although it can strike at any age and it most often affects boys. It lasts only a brief time and usually allows the kidneys to recover. In a few cases however kidney damage may be permanent requiring dialysis or transplantation to replace renal function. Bacterial endocarditis infection of the tissues inside the heart is also associated with subsequent glomerular disease. Researchers are not sure whether the renal lesions that form after a heart infection are caused entirely by the immune response or whether some other disease mechanism contributes to kidney damage. Treating the heart infection is the most effective way of minimizing kidney damage. Endocarditis sometimes produces chronic kidney disease CKD. HIV the virus that leads to AIDS can also cause glomerular disease. Between 5 and 10 percent of people with HIV experience kidney failure even before developing full-blown AIDS. HIV-associated nephropathy usually begins with heavy proteinuria and progresses rapidly within a year of detection to total kidney failure. Researchers are looking for therapies that can slow down or reverse this rapid deterioration of renal function but some possible solutions involving immunosuppression are risky because of the patients already compromised immune system. Sclerotic Diseases Glomerulosclerosis is scarring sclerosis of the glomeruli. In several sclerotic conditions a systemic disease like lupus or diabetes is responsible. Glomerulosclerosis is caused by the activation of glomerular cells to produce scar material. This may be stimulated by molecules called growth factors which may be made by glomerular cells themselves or may be brought to the glomerulus by the circulating blood that enters the glomerular filter. Diabetic nephropathy is the leading cause of glomerular disease and of total kidney failure in the United States. Kidney disease is one of several problems caused by elevated levels of blood glucose the central feature of diabetes. In addition to scarring the kidney elevated glucose levels appear to increase the speed of blood flow into the kidney putting a strain on the filtering glomeruli and raising blood pressure. Diabetic nephropathy usually takes many years to develop. People with diabetes can slow down damage to their kidneys by controlling their blood glucose through healthy eating with moderate protein intake physical activity and medications. People with diabetes should also be careful to keep their blood pressure at a level below 14090 mm Hg if possible. Blood pressure medications called ACE inhibitors and ARBs are particularly effective at minimizing kidney damage and are now frequently prescribed to control blood pressure in patients with diabetes and in patients with many forms of kidney disease. Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis FSGS describes scarring in scattered regions of the kidney typically limited to one part of the glomerulus and to a minority of glomeruli in the affected region. FSGS may result from a systemic disorder or it may develop as an idiopathic kidney disease without a known cause. Proteinuria is the most common symptom of FSGS but since proteinuria is associated with several other kidney conditions the doctor cannot diagnose FSGS on the basis of proteinuria alone. Biopsy may confirm the presence of glomerular scarring if the tissue is taken from the affected section of the kidney. But finding the affected section is a matter of chance especially early in the disease process when lesions may be scattered. Confirming a diagnosis of FSGS may require repeat kidney biopsies. Arriving at a diagnosis of idiopathic FSGS requires the identification of focal scarring and the elimination of possible systemic causes such as diabetes or an immune response to infection. Since idiopathic FSGS is by definition of unknown cause it is difficult to treat. No universal remedy has been found and most patients with FSGS progress to total kidney failure over 5 to 20 years. Some patients with an aggressive form of FSGS reach total kidney failure in 2 to 3 years. Treatments involving steroids or other immunosuppressive drugs appear to help some patients by decreasing proteinuria and improving kidney function. But these treatments are beneficial to only a minority of those in whom they are tried and some patients experience even poorer kidney function as a result. ACE inhibitors and ARBs may also be used in FSGS to decrease proteinuria. Treatment should focus on controlling blood pressure and blood cholesterol levels factors that may contribute to kidney scarring. Other Glomerular Diseases Membranous nephropathy also called membranous glomerulopathy is the second most common cause of the nephrotic syndrome proteinuria edema high cholesterol in U.S. adults after diabetic nephropathy. Diagnosis of membranous nephropathy requires a kidney biopsy which reveals unusual deposits of immunoglobulin G and complement C3 substances created by the body is immune system. Fully 75 percent of cases are idiopathic which means that the cause of the disease is unknown. The remaining 25 percent of cases are the result of other diseases like systemic lupus erythematosus hepatitis B or C infection or some forms of cancer. Drug therapies involving penicillamine gold or captopril have also been associated with membranous nephropathy. About 20 to 40 percent of patients with membranous nephropathy progress usually over decades to total kidney failure but most patients experience either complete remission or continued symptoms without progressive kidney failure. Doctors disagree about how aggressively to treat this condition since about 20 percent of patients recover without treatment. ACE inhibitors and ARBs are generally used to reduce proteinuria. Additional medication to control high blood pressure and edema is frequently required. Some patients benefit from steroids but this treatment does not work for everyone. Additional immunosuppressive medications are helpful for some patients with progressive disease. Minimal change disease MCD is the diagnosis given when a patient has the nephrotic syndrome and the kidney biopsy reveals little or no change to the structure of glomeruli or surrounding tissues when examined by a light microscope. Tiny drops of a fatty substance called a lipid may be present but no scarring has taken place within the kidney. MCD may occur at any age but it is most common in childhood. A small percentage of patients with idiopathic nephrotic syndrome do not respond to steroid therapy. For these patients the doctor may recommend a low-sodium diet and prescribe a diuretic to control edema. The doctor may recommend the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs to reduce proteinuria. ACE inhibitors and ARBs have also been used to reduce proteinuria in patients with steroid-resistant MCD. These patients may respond to larger doses of steroids more prolonged use of steroids or steroids in combination with immunosuppressant drugs such as chlorambucil cyclophosphamide or cyclosporine."

        "output": "Henoch-Schnlein purpura is caused by an abnormal immune system response in which the bodys immune system attacks the bodys own cells and organs. Usually the immune system makes antibodies or proteins to protect the body from foreign substances such as bacteria or viruses. In HSP these antibodies attack the blood vessels. The factors that cause this immune system response are not known. However in 30 to 50 percent of cases people have an upper respiratory tract infection such as a cold before getting HSP.2 HSP has also been associated with - infectious agents such as chickenpox measles hepatitis and HIV viruses - medications - foods - insect bites - exposure to cold weather - trauma Genetics may increase the risk of HSP as it has occurred in different members of the same family including in twins."

        "output": "The symptoms of HSP include the following - Rash. Leaking blood vessels in the skin cause a rash that looks like bruises or small red dots on the legs arms and buttocks. The rash may first look like hives and then change to look like bruises and it may spread to the chest back and face. The rash does not disappear or turn pale when pressed. - Digestive tract problems. HSP can cause vomiting and abdominal pain which can range from mild to severe. Blood may also appear in the stool though severe bleeding is rare. - Arthritis. Pain and swelling can occur in the joints usually in the knees and ankles and less frequently in the elbows and wrists. - Kidney involvement. Hematuria blood in the urineis a common sign that HSP has affected the kidneys. Proteinurialarge amounts of protein in the urineor development of high blood pressure suggests more severe kidney problems. - Other symptoms. In some cases boys with HSP develop swelling of the testicles. Symptoms affecting the central nervous system such as seizures and lungs such as pneumonia have been seen in rare cases. Though the rash affects all people with HSP pain in the joints or abdomen precedes the rash in about one-third of cases by as many as 14 days.1"

        "output": "Type 1 Classical Distal RTA Type 1 is also called classical distal RTA. Distal which means distant refers to the point in the urine-forming tube of the kidney where the defect occursrelatively distant from the point where fluid from the blood enters the tiny tube or tubule that collects fluid and wastes to form urine. This disorder may be inherited as a primary disorder or may be one symptom of a disease that affects many parts of the body. Researchers have discovered abnormal genes responsible for the inherited forms of the disease. More often however classical distal RTA occurs as a result of systemic diseasesdiseases that affect many organ systemslike the autoimmune disorders Sjgren is syndrome and lupus which also attack the distal tubule. Other diseases and conditions associated with classical distal RTA include sickle cell anemia hyperparathyroidism hyperthyroidism chronic active hepatitis primary biliary cirrhosis a hereditary form of deafness analgesic nephropathy rejection of a transplanted kidney renal medullary cystic disease obstructive uropathy and chronic urinary tract infections. Many of these conditions cause abnormal calcium deposits to build up in the kidney and impair distal tubule function. A major consequence of classical distal RTA is a low blood potassium level. The level drops if the kidneys excrete too much potassium into urine instead of returning it to the blood supply. Because potassium helps regulate nerve and muscle health and heart rate low levels can cause extreme weakness irregular heartbeat paralysis and even death. Untreated classical distal RTA causes growth retardation in children and progressive kidney and bone disease in adults. Restoring normal growth and preventing kidney stones are the major goals of therapy. If acidosis is corrected with sodium bicarbonate or sodium citrate then low blood-potassium salt depletion and calcium leakage into urine will be corrected. This alkali therapy also helps decrease the development of kidney stones and stabilizes kidney function so kidney failure does not progress. Infants may need potassium supplements but older children and adults rarely do because alkali therapy prevents the kidney from excreting potassium into the urine. Type 2 Proximal RTA Type 2 is also called proximal RTA. The word proximal which means near indicates that the defect is closer to the point where fluid and wastes from the blood enter the tubule. This form of RTA occurs most frequently in children as part of a disorder called Fanconi is syndrome. The features of Fanconi is syndrome include the abnormal excretion of glucose amino acids citrate and phosphate into the urine as well as vitamin D deficiency and low blood-potassium. Proximal RTA can also result from inherited disorders that disrupt the body is normal breakdown and use of nutrients. Examples include the rare disease cystinosis in which cystine crystals are deposited in bones and other tissues hereditary fructose intolerance and Wilson disease. Proximal RTA also occurs in patients treated with ifosfamide a drug used in chemotherapy. A few older drugssuch as acetazolamide or outdated tetracyclinecan also cause proximal RTA. In adults proximal RTA may complicate diseases like multiple myeloma or it may occur in people who experience chronic rejection of a transplanted kidney. When possible identifying and correcting the underlying causes are important steps in treating the acquired forms of proximal RTA. The diagnosis is based on the chemical analysis of blood and urine samples. Children with this disorder would likely receive large doses of an oral alkali such as sodium bicarbonate or potassium citrate to treat acidosis and prevent bone disorders kidney stones and growth failure. Correcting acidosis and low potassium levels restores normal growth patterns allowing bone to mature while preventing further renal disease. Vitamin D supplements may also be needed to help prevent bone problems. Type 3 Type 3 is rarely used as a classification because it is now thought to be a combination of type 1 and type 2. Type 4 Hyperkalemic RTA Type 4 is also called hyperkalemic RTA and is caused by a generalized transport abnormality of the distal tubule. The transport of electrolytes such as sodium chloride and potassium that normally occurs in the distal tubule is impaired. This form is distinguished from classical distal RTA and proximal RTA because it results in high levels of potassium in the blood instead of low levels. Either low potassiumhypokalemiaor high potassiumhyperkalemiacan be a problem because potassium is important in regulating heart rate. Type 4 RTA occurs when blood levels of the hormone aldosterone are low or when the kidneys do not respond to it. Aldosterone directs the kidneys to regulate the levels of sodium potassium and chloride in the blood. Type 4 RTA also occurs when the tubule transport of electrolytes such as sodium chloride and potassium is impaired due to an inherited disorder or the use of certain drugs. Drugs that may cause type 4 RTA include - diuretics used to treat congestive heart failure such as spironolactone or eplerenone - blood pressure drugs called angiotensin-converting enzyme ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers ARBs - the antibiotic trimethoprim - the antibiotic pentamidine which is used to treat pneumonia - an agent called heparin that keeps blood from clotting - a class of painkillers called nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs NSAIDs - some immunosuppressive drugs used to prevent rejection Type 4 RTA may also result from diseases that alter kidney structure and function such as diabetic nephropathy HIVAIDS Addison is disease sickle cell disease urinary tract obstruction lupus amyloidosis removal or destruction of both adrenal glands and kidney transplant rejection. For people who produce aldosterone but cannot use it researchers have identified the genetic basis for their body is resistance to the hormone. To treat type 4 RTA successfully patients may require alkaline agents to correct acidosis and medication to lower the potassium in their blood. If treated early most people with any type of RTA will not develop permanent kidney failure. Therefore the goal is early recognition and adequate therapy which will need to be maintained and monitored throughout the person is lifetime."

        "output": "The complications of benign prostatic hyperplasia treatment depend on the type of treatment. Medications Medications used to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia may have side effects that sometimes can be serious. Men who are prescribed medications to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia should discuss possible side effects with a health care provider before taking the medications. Men who experience the following side effects should contact a health care provider right away or get emergency medical care - hives - rash - itching - shortness of breath - rapid pounding or irregular heartbeat - painful erection of the penis that lasts for hours - swelling of the eyes face tongue lips throat arms hands feet ankles or lower legs - difficulty breathing or swallowing - chest pain - dizziness or fainting when standing up suddenly - sudden decrease or loss of vision - blurred vision - sudden decrease or loss of hearing - chest pain dizziness or nausea during sexual activity These side effects are mostly related to phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors. Side effects related to alpha blockers include - dizziness or fainting when standing up suddenly - decreased sexual drive - problems with ejaculation Minimally Invasive Procedures Complications after minimally invasive procedures may include - UTIs - painful urination - difficulty urinating - an urgent or a frequent need to urinate - urinary incontinence - blood in the urine for several days after the procedure - sexual dysfunction - chronic prostatitislong-lasting inflammation of the prostate - recurring problems such as urinary retention and UTIs Most of the complications of minimally invasive procedures go away within a few days or weeks. Minimally invasive procedures are less likely to have complications than surgery. Surgery Complications after surgery may include - problems urinating - urinary incontinence - bleeding and blood clots - infection - scar tissue - sexual dysfunction - recurring problems such as urinary retention and UTIs Problems urinating. Men may initially have painful urination or difficulty urinating. They may experience urinary frequency urgency or retention. These problems will gradually lessen and after a couple of months urination will be easier and less frequent. Urinary incontinence. As the bladder returns to normal men may have some temporary problems controlling urination. However long-term urinary incontinence rarely occurs. The longer urinary problems existed before surgery the longer it takes for the bladder to regain its full function after surgery. Bleeding and blood clots. After benign prostatic hyperplasia surgery the prostate or tissues around it may bleed. Blood or blood clots may appear in urine. Some bleeding is normal and should clear up within several days. However men should contact a health care provider right away if - they experience pain or discomfort - their urine contains large clots - their urine is so red it is difficult to see through Blood clots from benign prostatic hyperplasia surgery can pass into the bloodstream and lodge in other parts of the bodymost often the legs. Men should contact a health care provider right away if they experience swelling or discomfort in their legs. Infection. Use of a Foley catheter after benign prostatic hyperplasia surgery may increase the risk of a UTI. Anesthesia during surgery may cause urinary retention and also increase the risk of a UTI. In addition the incision site of an open prostatectomy may become infected. A health care provider will prescribe antibiotics to treat infections. Scar tissue. In the year after the original surgery scar tissue sometimes forms and requires surgical treatment. Scar tissue may form in the urethra and cause it to narrow. A urologist can solve this problem during an office visit by stretching the urethra. Rarely the opening of the bladder becomes scarred and shrinks causing blockage. This problem may require a surgical procedure similar to TUIP. Sexual dysfunction. Some men may experience temporary problems with sexual function after benign prostatic hyperplasia surgery. The length of time for restored sexual function depends on the type of benign prostatic hyperplasia surgery performed and how long symptoms were present before surgery. Many men have found that concerns about sexual function can interfere with sex as much as the benign prostatic hyperplasia surgery itself. Understanding the surgical procedure and talking about concerns with a health care provider before surgery often help men regain sexual function earlier. Many men find it helpful to talk with a counselor during the adjustment period after surgery. Even though it can take a while for sexual function to fully return with time most men can enjoy sex again. Most health care providers agree that if men with benign prostatic hyperplasia were able to maintain an erection before surgery they will probably be able to have erections afterward. Surgery rarely causes a loss of erectile function. However benign prostatic hyperplasia surgery most often cannot restore function that was lost before the procedure. Some men find a slight difference in the quality of orgasm after surgery. However most report no difference. Prostate surgery may make men sterile or unable to father children by causing retrograde ejaculationthe backward flow of semen into the bladder. Men flush the semen out of the bladder when they urinate. In some cases medications such as pseudoephedrine found in many cold medications or imipramine can treat retrograde ejaculation. These medications improve muscle tone at the bladder neck and keep semen from entering the bladder. Recurring problems. Men may require further treatment if prostate problems including benign prostatic hyperplasia return. Problems may arise when treatments for benign prostatic hyperplasia leave a good part of the prostate intact. About 10 percent of men treated with TURP or TUIP require additional surgery within 5 years. About 2 percent of men who have an open prostatectomy require additional surgery within 5 years.2 In the years after benign prostatic hyperplasia surgery or treatment men should continue having a digital rectal exam once a year and have any symptoms checked by a health care provider. In some cases the health care provider may recommend a digital rectal exam and checkup more than once a year."

        "output": "Heart failure is caused by other diseases or conditions that damage the heart muscle such as coronary artery disease including heart attacks diabetes and high blood pressure. Treating these problems can prevent or improve heart failure. Coronary Artery Disease Coronary artery disease is a leading cause of death in men and women. It happens when the arteries that supply blood to the heart become hardened and narrowed. High Blood Pressure High blood pressure is the force of blood pushing against the walls of the arteries. If this pressure rises and stays high over time it can weaken your heart and lead to plaque buildup which can then lead to heart failure. Diabetes Diabetes is characterized by having too much glucose or sugar in the blood for a long time. This can cause heart problems because high blood glucose can damage parts of the body such as the heart and blood vessels. This damage weakens the heart often leading to heart failure. Other Diseases Other diseases and conditions also can lead to heart failure such as - Cardiomyopathy KAR-de-o-mi-OP-ah-thee or heart muscle disease. Cardiomyopathy may be present at birth or caused by injury or infection. - Heart valve disease. Problems with the heart valves may be present at birth or caused by infection heart attack or damage from heart disease. - Arrhythmias ah-RITH-me-ahs or irregular heartbeats.

Other Factors Other factors also can injure the heart muscle and lead to heart failure. Examples include - treatments for cancer such as radiation and chemotherapy - thyroid disorders having either too much or too little thyroid hormone in the body - alcohol abuse or cocaine and other illegal drug use - HIVAIDS - too much vitamin E. treatments for cancer such as radiation and chemotherapy thyroid disorders having either too much or too little thyroid hormone in the body alcohol abuse or cocaine and other illegal drug use HIVAIDS too much vitamin E. Sleep Apnea Heart damage from obstructive sleep apnea may worsen heart failure. Sleep apnea is a common disorder in which you have one or more pauses in breathing or shallow breaths while you sleep. Sleep apnea can deprive your heart of oxygen and increase its workload. Treating this sleep disorder might improve heart failure. Who Is at Risk Heart failure can happen to almost anyone. It is the number one reason for hospitalization for people over age 65. Heart failure is more common in - people who are 65 years old or older - African-Americans - people who are overweight - people who have had a heart attack - men. people who are 65 years old or older African-Americans people who are overweight people who have had a heart attack men. Aging can weaken the heart muscle. Older people also may have had diseases for many years that led to heart failure. African Americans are more likely to have heart failure than people of other races. They are also more likely to have symptoms at a younger age have more hospital visits due to heart failure and die from heart failure. Excess weight puts strain on the heart. Being overweight also increases your risk of heart disease and type 2 diabetes. These diseases can lead to heart failure. A history of a heart attack puts people at greater risk for heart failure. Men have a higher rate of heart failure than women."

        "instruction": "What is are Shingles ",
        "output": "Shingles is a painful rash that develops on one side of the face or body. The rash forms blisters that typically scab over in 7 to 10 days and clear up within 2 to 4 weeks. Most commonly the rash occurs in a single stripe around either the left or the right side of the body. In other cases the rash occurs on one side of the face. In rare cases usually among people with weakened immune systems the rash may be more widespread and look similar to a chickenpox rash. Shingles is very common. Fifty percent of all Americans will have had shingles by the time they are 80. While shingles occurs in people of all ages it is most common in 60- to 80-year-olds. In fact one out of every three people 60 years or older will get shingles. Watch the video to learn more about shingles. To enlarge the video click the brackets in the lower right-hand corner. To reduce the video press the Escape Esc button on your keyboard. What Causes Shingles Shingles is caused by a reactivation of the chickenpox virus. It is distinctive because it affects only one side of the body. The early signs of shingles usually develop in three stages severe pain or tingling possibly itchy rash and blisters that look like chickenpox. The virus that causes shingles is a herpes virus Another name for shingles is herpes zoster. Once you are infected with this kind of virus it remains in your body for life. It stays inactive until a period when your immunity is down. Shingles and Pain The most common complication of shingles is pain -- a condition called post-herpetic neuralgia PHN. People with PHN have severe pain in the areas where they had the shingles rash even after the rash clears up. In most patients the pain usually clears up in a few weeks or months but some people can have pain from PHN for years. Persistent pain from shingles is a common symptom in people over 60. In fact one out of six people older than 60 years who get shingles will have severe pain. As people get older they are more likely to develop long-term pain as a complication of shingles and the pain is likely to be more severe. Other Complications Shingles may also lead to other serious complications. - Outbreaks that start on the face or eyes can cause vision or hearing problems. Even permanent blindness can result if the cornea of the eye is affected. - Bacterial infection of the open sores can lead to scarring. Outbreaks that start on the face or eyes can cause vision or hearing problems. Even permanent blindness can result if the cornea of the eye is affected. Bacterial infection of the open sores can lead to scarring. - In a very small number of cases bacteria can cause more serious conditions including toxic shock syndrome and necrotizing fasciitis a severe infection that destroys the soft tissue under the skin. - The burning waves of pain loss of sleep and interference with even basic life activities can cause serious depression. - In patients with immune deficiency the rash can be much more extensive than usual and the illness can be complicated by pneumonia. These cases are more serious but they are rarely fatal. - Very rarely shingles can also lead to pneumonia brain inflammation encephalitis or death.

In patients with immune deficiency the rash can be much more extensive than usual and the illness can be complicated by pneumonia. These cases are more serious but they are rarely fatal. Very rarely shingles can also lead to pneumonia brain inflammation encephalitis or death. Shingles Usually Does Not Return People who develop shingles usually have only one episode in their lifetime. However a person can have a second or even a third episode. The Shingles Vaccine Adults 60 years old or older should talk to their healthcare professional about getting a one-time dose of the shingles vaccine. The vaccine can reduce your risk of shingles and the long-term pain it can cause. If you have already had shingles or you have a chronic medical condition you can receive the shingles vaccine. See more about the shingles vaccine in the chapter Prevention. Is Shingles Contagious Shingles cannot be passed from one person to another. However the virus that causes shingles the varicella zoster virus can be spread from a person with active shingles to another person who has never had chickenpox. In such cases the person exposed to the virus might develop chickenpox but they would not develop shingles. The virus is spread through direct contact with fluid from the rash blisters caused by shingles. A person with active shingles can spread the virus when the rash is in the blister phase. A person is not infectious before the blisters appear. Once the rash has developed crusts the person is no longer contagious. Shingles is less contagious than chickenpox and the risk of a person with shingles spreading the virus is low if the rash is covered. If You Have Shingles If you have shingles - keep the rash covered - avoid touching or scratching the rash - wash your hands often to prevent the spread of varicella zoster virus. keep the rash covered avoid touching or scratching the rash wash your hands often to prevent the spread of varicella zoster virus. Until your rash has developed crusts avoid contact with - pregnant women who have never had chickenpox or the chickenpox vaccine - premature or low birth weight infants - people with weakened immune systems such as people receiving immunosuppressive medications or undergoing chemotherapy organ transplant recipients and people with human immunodeficiency virus HIV infection. pregnant women who have never had chickenpox or the chickenpox vaccine premature or low birth weight infants people with weakened immune systems such as people receiving immunosuppressive medications or undergoing chemotherapy organ transplant recipients and people with human immunodeficiency virus HIV infection. If you have not had chickenpox and you come into contact with someone who has shingles ask your healthcare provider whether you should get a chickenpox vaccination.

        "output": "Caused By A Virus Shingles is caused by a virus called varicella-zoster virus -- the one that gave you chickenpox when you were a child. As you recovered from chickenpox the sores healed and the other symptoms went away but the virus remained. It is with you for life. The virus hides out in nerve cells usually in the spine. But it can become active again. Somehow the virus gets a signal that your immunity has become weakened. This triggers the reactivation. When the virus becomes active again it follows a nerve path called a dermatome. The nerve path begins at specific points in the spine continues around one side of the body and surfaces at the nerve endings in the skin. The pattern of the rash reflects the location of that nerve path. Risk Factors The leading risk factor for shingles is a history of having had chickenpox. One out of every five people who have had chickenpox is likely to get shingles. Another risk factor is aging. As we age our natural immunity gradually loses its ability to protect against infection. The shingles virus can take advantage of this and become active again. Conditions that weaken the immune system can also put people at risk for shingles. Shingles is especially dangerous for anyone who has had cancer radiation treatments for cancer HIVAIDS or a transplant operation. Stress is another factor that may contribute to outbreaks. While stress alone does not cause the outbreaks shingles often occurs in people who have recently had a stressful event in their lives. Most cases of shingles occur in adults. Only about 5 percent of cases occur in children. With children immune deficiency is the primary risk factor but children who had chickenpox before they were one year old may also get shingles before they become adults. There have been studies of adults who had chickenpox as children and were later exposed to children who had chickenpox. Interestingly that exposure apparently boosted the adult is immunity which actually helped them avoid getting shingles later in life."

        "output": "A Vaccine for Adults 60 and Older In May 2006 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved a vaccine Zostavax to prevent shingles in people age 60 and older. The vaccine is designed to boost the immune system and protect older adults from getting shingles later on. Even if you have had shingles you can still get the shingles vaccine to help prevent future occurrences of the disease. There is no maximum age for getting the vaccine and only a single dose is recommended. In a clinical trial involving thousands of adults 60 years old or older the vaccine reduced the risk of shingles by about half. A One-time Dose To reduce the risk of shingles adults 60 years old or older should talk to their healthcare professional about getting a one-time dose of the shingles vaccine. Even if the shingles vaccine doesnt prevent you from getting shingles it can still reduce the chance of having long-term pain. If you have had shingles before you can still get the shingles vaccine to help prevent future occurrences of the disease. There is no maximum age for getting the vaccine. Side Effects Vaccine side effects are usually mild and temporary. In most cases shingles vaccine causes no serious side effects. Some people experience mild reactions that last up to a few days such as headache or redness soreness swelling or itching where the shot was given. When To Get the Vaccine The decision on when to get vaccinated should be made with your health care provider. The shingles vaccine is not recommended if you have active shingles or pain that continues after the rash is gone. Although there is no specific time that you must wait after having shingles before receiving the shingles vaccine you should generally make sure that the shingles rash has disappeared before getting vaccinated. Where To Get the Vaccine The shingles vaccine is available in doctors offices pharmacies workplaces community health clinics and health departments. Most private health insurance plans cover recommended vaccines. Check with your insurance provider for details and for a list of vaccine providers. Medicare Part D plans cover shingles vaccine but there may be costs to you depending on your specific plan. If you do not have health insurance visit www.healthcare.gov to learn more about health insurance options. Who Should Not Get the Vaccine You should NOT get the shingles vaccine if you - have an active case of shingles or have pain that continues after the rash is gone - have ever had a life-threatening or severe allergic reaction to gelatin the antibiotic neomycin or any other component of the shingles vaccine. Tell your doctor if you have any severe allergies. - have a weakened immune system because of -- HIVAIDS or another disease that affects the immune system -- treatment with drugs that affect the immune system such as steroids -- cancer treatment such as radiation or chemotherapy -- cancer affecting the bone marrow or lymphatic system such as leukemia or lymphoma. have an active case of shingles or have pain that continues after the rash is gone have ever had a life-threatening or severe allergic reaction to gelatin the antibiotic neomycin or any other component of the shingles vaccine.

To learn more about the vaccine see Zostavax Questions and Answers. Could Vaccines Make Shingles a Rare Disease The shingles vaccine is basically a stronger version of the chickenpox vaccine which became available in 1995. The chickenpox shot prevents chickenpox in 70 to 90 percent of those vaccinated and 95 percent of the rest have only mild symptoms. Millions of children and adults have already received the chickenpox shot. Interestingly the chickenpox vaccine may reduce the shingles problem. Widespread use of the chickenpox vaccine means that fewer people will get chickenpox in the future. And if people do not get chickenpox they cannot get shingles. Use of the shingles and chickenpox vaccines may one day make shingles a rare disease. To find out more visit Shingles Vaccination What You Need to Know or Shingles Vaccine"

        "instruction": "What causes Skin Cancer ",
        "output": "Scientists have been able to identify the causes and risk factors for skin cancer. A risk factor is anything that increases your chances of getting a disease. DNA Damage One of the main reasons that skin cancer develops is because DNA is damaged. DNA is the master molecule that controls and directs every cell in the body. Damage to DNA is one of the ways that cells lose control of growth and become cancerous. DNA mutations can also be inherited. Exposure to Ultraviolet Radiation Excess exposure to ultraviolet UV light can damage the DNA in skin cells and increase a person is risk for both melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancer. UV light is invisible radiation from the sun that can damage DNA. Skin cells are especially susceptible to DNA damage since they are frequently exposed to UV light. There are three types of UV radiation A B and C. All three are dangerous and able to penetrate skin cells. UVA is the most common on earth and is harmful to the skin. UVB is less common because some of it is absorbed by the ozone layer. It is less harmful than UVA but can still cause damage. UVC is the least dangerous because although it can cause the most damage to the skin almost all of the UVC rays are absorbed by the ozone layer. Sources of Ultraviolet Radiation UV radiation comes from the sun sunlamps tanning beds or tanning booths. UV radiation is present even in cold weather or on a cloudy day. A person is risk of skin cancer is related to lifetime exposure to UV radiation. Most skin cancer appears after age 50 but the sun damages the skin from an early age. The body has systems to repair DNA and control some mutations but not all of them. The risk of cancer increases as we age because sometimes cancer is caused by many mutations accumulating over time. Role of the Immune System The body is immune system is also responsible for recognizing and killing abnormal cells before they become cancerous. As we get older our immune systems are less able to fight infection and control cell growth. People whose immune system is weakened by certain other cancers medications or by HIV are at an increased risk of developing skin cancer. Basal Cell and Squamous Cell Carcinoma Besides risk factors that increase a person is chance of getting any type of skin cancer there are risk factors that are specific to basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma the non-melanoma skin cancers. These risk factors include - scars or burns on the skin - chronic skin inflammation or skin ulcers - infection with certain human papilloma viruses - exposure to arsenic at work - radiation therapy - diseases that make the skin sensitive to the sun such as xeroderma pigmentosum albinism and basal cell nevus syndrome - medical conditions or drugs that suppress the immune system - personal history of one or more skin cancers - family history of skin cancer - certain diseases of the skin including actinic keratosis and Bowen is disease. scars or burns on the skin chronic skin inflammation or skin ulcers infection with certain human papilloma viruses exposure to arsenic at work radiation therapy diseases that make the skin sensitive to the sun such as xeroderma pigmentosum albinism and basal cell nevus syndrome medical conditions or drugs that suppress the immune system personal history of one or more skin cancers family history of skin cancer certain diseases of the skin including actinic keratosis and Bowen is disease. Someone who has one or more of these risk factors has a greater chance of getting skin cancer than someone who does not have these risk factors. However having these risk factors does not guarantee a person will get skin cancer. Many genetic and environmental factors play a role in causing cancer. Melanoma Melanoma is less common than non-melanoma skin cancers like basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma but it is more serious. The factors that increase a person is chance of getting melanoma are - severe blistering sunburns earlier in life - unusual moles normally benign clusters of melanocytes - large quantity of ordinary moles more than 50 - white or light-colored fair skin especially with freckles. - blond or red hair - blue or green eyes - being older than 20 years of age. severe blistering sunburns earlier in life unusual moles normally benign clusters of melanocytes large quantity of ordinary moles more than 50 white or light-colored fair skin especially with freckles. blond or red hair blue or green eyes being older than 20 years of age. Someone who has one or more of these risk factors has a greater chance of getting melanoma than someone who does not have these risk factors. However having these risk factors does not guarantee a person will get cancer. Many genetic and environmental factors play a role in causing cancer. Reducing Your Risk While exposure to UV radiation is a major risk factor for cancer skin cancer can occur anywhere on the skin not just in sun-exposed areas. The best ways to reduce your risk of skin cancer are to - avoid outdoor activities during midday when the sun is rays are strongest - wear protective clothing such as a wide-brimmed hat long-sleeved shirt and pants. avoid outdoor activities during midday when the sun is rays are strongest wear protective clothing such as a wide-brimmed hat long-sleeved shirt and pants. Darker-colored clothing is more protective against the sun. For example a white t-shirt particularly if it gets wet provides little resistance to UV rays. In addition wearing sunglasses that wrap around the face or have large frames is a good way to shield the delicate skin around the eyes. Wear Sunscreen and Lipscreen When exposed to sunlight you should always wear sunscreen and lipscreen. If possible choose sunscreen and lipscreen labeled broad-spectrum to protect against UVA and UVB rays. Your sunscreen should have an SPF or sun protection rating of at least 15. The SPF of a sunscreen is a measure of the time it takes to produce a sunburn in a person wearing sunscreen compared to the time it takes to produce a sunburn in a person not wearing sunscreen. This varies from person to person so be sure to reapply sunscreen every 2-3 hours."

        "instruction": "What causes Anemia ",
        "output": "The three main causes of anemia are Blood loss Lack of red blood cell production High rates of red blood cell destruction For some people the condition is caused by more than one of these factors. Blood Loss Blood loss is the most common cause of anemia especially iron-deficiency anemia. Blood loss can be short term or persist over time. Heavy menstrual periods or bleeding in the digestive or urinary tract can cause blood loss. Surgery trauma or cancer also can cause blood loss. If a lot of blood is lost the body may lose enough red blood cells to cause anemia. Lack of Red Blood Cell Production Both acquired and inherited conditions and factors can prevent your body from making enough red blood cells. Acquired means you are not born with the condition but you develop it. Inherited means your parents passed the gene for the condition on to you. Acquired conditions and factors that can lead to anemia include poor diet abnormal hormone levels some chronic ongoing diseases and pregnancy. Aplastic anemia also can prevent your body from making enough red blood cells. This condition can be acquired or inherited. Diet A diet that lacks iron folic acid folate or vitamin B12 can prevent your body from making enough red blood cells. Your body also needs small amounts of vitamin C riboflavin and copper to make red blood cells. Conditions that make it hard for your body to absorb nutrients also can prevent your body from making enough red blood cells. Hormones Your body needs the hormone erythropoietin eh-rith-ro-POY-eh-tin to make red blood cells. This hormone stimulates the bone marrow to make these cells. A low level of this hormone can lead to anemia. Diseases and Disease Treatments Chronic diseases like kidney disease and cancer can make it hard for your body to make enough red blood cells. Some cancer treatments may damage the bone marrow or damage the red blood cells ability to carry oxygen. If the bone marrow is damaged it can not make red blood cells fast enough to replace the ones that die or are destroyed. People who have HIVAIDS may develop anemia due to infections or medicines used to treat their diseases. Pregnancy Anemia can occur during pregnancy due to low levels of iron and folic acid and changes in the blood. During the first 6 months of pregnancy the fluid portion of a woman is blood the plasma increases faster than the number of red blood cells. This dilutes the blood and can lead to anemia. Aplastic Anemia Some infants are born without the ability to make enough red blood cells. This condition is called aplastic anemia. Infants and children who have aplastic anemia often need blood transfusions to increase the number of red blood cells in their blood. Acquired conditions or factors such as certain medicines toxins and infectious diseases also can cause aplastic anemia. High Rates of Red Blood Cell Destruction Both acquired and inherited conditions and factors can cause your body to destroy too many red blood cells. One example of an acquired condition is an enlarged or diseased spleen. The spleen is an organ that removes wornout red blood cells from the body. If the spleen is enlarged or diseased it may remove more red blood cells than normal causing anemia. Examples of inherited conditions that can cause your body to destroy too many red blood cells include sickle cell anemia thalassemias and lack of certain enzymes. These conditions create defects in the red blood cells that cause them to die faster than healthy red blood cells. Hemolytic anemia is another example of a condition in which your body destroys too many red blood cells. Inherited or acquired conditions or factors can cause hemolytic anemia. Examples include immune disorders infections certain medicines or reactions to blood transfusions."

        "output": "Anemia is a common condition. It occurs in all age racial and ethnic groups. Both men and women can have anemia. However women of childbearing age are at higher risk for the condition because of blood loss from menstruation. Anemia can develop during pregnancy due to low levels of iron and folic acid folate and changes in the blood. During the first 6 months of pregnancy the fluid portion of a woman is blood the plasma increases faster than the number of red blood cells. This dilutes the blood and can lead to anemia. During the first year of life some babies are at risk for anemia because of iron deficiency. At-risk infants include those who are born too early and infants who are fed breast milk only or formula that is not fortified with iron. These infants can develop iron deficiency by 6 months of age. Infants between 1 and 2 years of age also are at risk for anemia. They may not get enough iron in their diets especially if they drink a lot of cow is milk. Cow is milk is low in the iron needed for growth. Drinking too much cow is milk may keep an infant or toddler from eating enough iron-rich foods or absorbing enough iron from foods. Older adults also are at increased risk for anemia. Researchers continue to study how the condition affects older adults. Many of these people have other medical conditions as well. Major Risk Factors Factors that raise your risk for anemia include A diet that is low in iron vitamins or minerals Blood loss from surgery or an injury Long-term or serious illnesses such as kidney disease cancer diabetes rheumatoid arthritis HIVAIDS inflammatory bowel disease including Crohn is disease liver disease heart failure and thyroid disease Long-term infections A family history of inherited anemia such as sickle cell anemia or thalassemia"

Other signs and symptoms of anemia include Shortness of breath Dizziness Headache Coldness in the hands and feet Pale skin Chest pain These signs and symptoms can occur because your heart has to work harder to pump oxygen-rich blood through your body. Mild to moderate anemia may cause very mild symptoms or none at all. Complications of Anemia Some people who have anemia may have arrhythmias ah-RITH-me-ahs. Arrhythmias are problems with the rate or rhythm of the heartbeat. Over time arrhythmias can damage your heart and possibly lead to heart failure. Anemia also can damage other organs in your body because your blood can not get enough oxygen to them. Anemia can weaken people who have cancer or HIVAIDS. This can make their treatments not work as well. Anemia also can cause many other health problems. People who have kidney disease and anemia are more likely to have heart problems. With some types of anemia too little fluid intake or too much loss of fluid in the blood and body can occur. Severe loss of fluid can be life threatening."

Acquired aplastic anemia is more common and sometimes it is only temporary. Inherited aplastic anemia is rare. In many people who have aplastic anemia the cause is unknown. Some research suggests that stem cell damage may occur because the body is immune system attacks its own cells by mistake. Acquired Causes Many diseases conditions and factors can cause aplastic anemia including Toxins such as pesticides arsenic and benzene. Radiation and chemotherapy treatments for cancer. Medicines such as chloramphenicol an antibiotic rarely used in the United States. Infectious diseases such as hepatitis Epstein-Barr virus cytomegalovirus si-to-MEG-ah-lo-VI-rus parvovirus B19 and HIV. Autoimmune disorders such as lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. Pregnancy.

As the heart weakens certain proteins and substances might be released into the blood. These substances have a toxic effect on the heart and blood flow and they worsen heart failure. Causes of heart failure include Coronary heart disease Diabetes High blood pressure Other heart conditions or diseases Other factors Coronary Heart Disease Coronary heart disease is a condition in which a waxy substance called plaque builds up inside the coronary arteries. These arteries supply oxygen-rich blood to your heart muscle. Plaque narrows the arteries and reduces blood flow to your heart muscle. The buildup of plaque also makes it more likely that blood clots will form in your arteries. Blood clots can partially or completely block blood flow. Coronary heart disease can lead to chest pain or discomfort calledangina aheart attack and heart damage. Diabetes Diabetes is a disease in which the bodys blood glucose sugar level is too high. The body normally breaks down food into glucose and then carries it to cells throughout the body. The cells use a hormone called insulin to turn the glucose into energy. In diabetes the body doesnt make enough insulin or doesnt use its insulin properly. Over time high blood sugar levels can damage and weaken the heart muscle and the blood vessels around the heart leading to heart failure. High Blood Pressure Blood pressure is the force of blood pushing against the walls of the arteries. If this pressure rises and stays high over time it can weaken your heart and lead to plaque buildup. Blood pressure is considered high if it stays at or above 14090 mmHg over time. The mmHg is millimeters of mercurythe units used to measure blood pressure. If you have diabetes or chronic kidney disease high blood pressure is defined as 13080 mmHg or higher. Other Heart Conditions or Diseases Other conditions and diseases also can lead to heart failure such as Arrhythmia. Happens when a problem occurs with the rate or rhythm of the heartbeat. Cardiomyopathy.Happens when the heart muscle becomes enlarged thick or rigid. Congenital heart defects. Problems with the hearts structure are present at birth. Heart valve disease. Occurs if one or more of your heart valves doesnt work properly which can be present at birth or caused by infection other heart conditions and age. Other Factors Other factors also can injure the heart muscle and lead to heart failure.

        "instruction": "What are the treatments for Hemophilia ",
        "output": "Treatment With Replacement Therapy The main treatment for hemophilia is called replacement therapy. Concentrates of clotting factor VIII for hemophilia A or clotting factor IX for hemophilia B are slowly dripped or injected into a vein. These infusions help replace the clotting factor that is missing or low. Clotting factor concentrates can be made from human blood. The blood is treated to prevent the spread of diseases such as hepatitis. With the current methods of screening and treating donated blood the risk of getting an infectious disease from human clotting factors is very small. To further reduce the risk you or your child can take clotting factor concentrates that are not made from human blood. These are called recombinant clotting factors. Clotting factors are easy to store mix and use at homeit only takes about 15 minutes to receive the factor. You may have replacement therapy on a regular basis to prevent bleeding. This is called preventive or prophylactic PRO-fih-lac-tik therapy. Or you may only need replacement therapy to stop bleeding when it occurs. This use of the treatment on an as-needed basis is called demand therapy. Demand therapy is less intensive and expensive than preventive therapy. However there is a risk that bleeding will cause damage before you receive the demand therapy. Complications of Replacement Therapy Complications of replacement therapy include Developing antibodies proteins that attack the clotting factor Developing viral infections from human clotting factors Damage to joints muscles or other parts of the body resulting from delays in treatment Antibodies to the clotting factor. Antibodies can destroy the clotting factor before it has a chance to work. This is a very serious problem. It prevents the main treatment for hemophilia replacement therapy from working. These antibodies also called inhibitors develop in about 2030 percent of people who have severe hemophilia A. Inhibitors develop in 25 percent of people who have hemophilia B. When antibodies develop doctors may use larger doses of clotting factor or try different clotting factor sources. Sometimes the antibodies go away. Researchers are studying new ways to deal with antibodies to clotting factors. Viruses from human clotting factors. Clotting factors made from human blood can carry the viruses that cause HIVAIDS and hepatitis. However the risk of getting an infectious disease from human clotting factors is very small due to Careful screening of blood donors Testing of donated blood products Treating donated blood products with a detergent and heat to destroy viruses Vaccinating people who have hemophilia for hepatitis A and B Damage to joints muscles and other parts of the body. Delays in treatment can cause damage such as Bleeding into a joint. If this happens many times it can lead to changes in the shape of the joint and impair the joint is function. Swelling of the membrane around a joint. Pain swelling and redness of a joint. Pressure on a joint from swelling which can destroy the joint. Home Treatment With Replacement Therapy You can do both preventive ongoing and demand as-needed replacement therapy at home. Many people learn to do the infusions at home for their child or for themselves. Home treatment has several advantages You or your child can get quicker treatment when bleeding happens. Early treatment lowers the risk of complications. Fewer visits to the doctor or emergency room are needed. Home treatment costs less than treatment in a medical care setting. Home treatment helps children accept treatment and take responsibility for their own health. Discuss options for home treatment with your doctor or your child is doctor. A doctor or other health care provider can teach you the steps and safety procedures for home treatment. Hemophilia treatment centers are another good resource for learning about home treatment discussed in Living With Hemophilia. Doctors can surgically implant vein access devices to make it easier for you to access a vein for treatment with replacement therapy. These devices can be helpful if treatment occurs often. However infections can be a problem with these devices. Your doctor can help you decide whether this type of device is right for you or your child. Other Types of Treatment Desmopressin Desmopressin DDAVP is a man-made hormone used to treat people who have mild hemophilia A. DDAVP is not used to treat hemophilia B or severe hemophilia A. DDAVP stimulates the release of stored factor VIII and von Willebrand factor it also increases the level of these proteins in your blood. Von Willebrand factor carries and binds factor VIII which can then stay in the bloodstream longer. DDAVP usually is given by injection or as nasal spray. Because the effect of this medicine wears off if it is used often the medicine is given only in certain situations. For example you may take this medicine prior to dental work or before playing certain sports to prevent or reduce bleeding. Antifibrinolytic Medicines Antifibrinolytic medicines including tranexamic acid and epsilon aminocaproic acid may be used with replacement therapy. They are usually given as a pill and they help keep blood clots from breaking down. These medicines most often are used before dental work or to treat bleeding from the mouth or nose or mild intestinal bleeding. Gene Therapy Researchers are trying to find ways to correct the faulty genes that cause hemophilia. Gene therapy has not yet developed to the point that it is an accepted treatment for hemophilia. However researchers continue to test gene therapy in clinical trials. For more information go to the Clinical Trials section of this article. Treatment of a Specific Bleeding Site Pain medicines steroids and physical therapy may be used to reduce pain and swelling in an affected joint. Talk with your doctor or pharmacist about which medicines are safe for you to take. Which Treatment Is Best for You The type of treatment you or your child receives depends on several things including how severe the hemophilia is the activities you will be doing and the dental or medical procedures you will be having. Mild hemophiliaReplacement therapy usually is not needed for mild hemophilia. Sometimes though DDAVP is given to raise the body is level of factor VIII. Moderate hemophiliaYou may need replacement therapy only when bleeding occurs or to prevent bleeding that could occur when doing certain activities. Your doctor also may recommend DDAVP prior to having a procedure or doing an activity that increases the risk of bleeding. Severe hemophiliaYou usually need replacement therapy to prevent bleeding that could damage your joints muscles or other parts of your body. Typically replacement therapy is given at home two or three times a week. This preventive therapy usually is started in patients at a young age and may need to continue for life. For both types of hemophilia getting quick treatment for bleeding is important. Quick treatment can limit damage to your body. If you or your child has hemophilia learn to recognize signs of bleeding. Other family members also should learn to watch for signs of bleeding in a child who has hemophilia. Children sometimes ignore signs of bleeding because they want to avoid the discomfort of treatment."

        "output": "Sometimes doctors can find out what is causing pulmonary fibrosis lung scarring. For example exposure to environmental pollutants and certain medicines can cause the disease. Environmental pollutants include inorganic dust silica and hard metal dusts and organic dust bacteria and animal proteins. Medicines that are known to cause pulmonary fibrosis in some people include nitrofurantoin an antibiotic amiodarone a heart medicine methotrexate and bleomycin both chemotherapy medicines and many other medicines. In most cases however the cause of lung scarring isnt known. These cases are called idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis IPF. With IPF doctors think that something inside or outside of the lungs attacks them again and again over time. These attacks injure the lungs and scar the tissue inside and between the air sacs. This makes it harder for oxygen to pass through the air sac walls into the bloodstream. The following factors may increase your risk of IPF Cigarette smoking Viral infections including Epstein-Barr virus which causes mononucleosis influenza A virus hepatitis C virus HIV and herpes virus 6 Genetics also may play a role in causing IPF. Some families have at least two members who have IPF. Researchers have found that 9 out of 10 people who have IPF also have gastroesophageal reflux disease GERD. GERD is a condition in which acid from your stomach backs up into your throat. Some people who have GERD may regularly breathe in tiny drops of acid from their stomachs. The acid can injure their lungs and lead to IPF. More research is needed to confirm this theory."

In ITP however your immune system attacks and destroys your body is platelets by mistake. Why this happens is not known. In some people ITP may be linked to viral or bacterial infections such as HIV hepatitis C or H. pylori. Children who have acute short-term ITP often have had recent viral infections. These infections may trigger or set off the immune reaction that leads to ITP."

        "instruction": "How to diagnose Immune Thrombocytopenia ",
        "output": "Your doctor will diagnose immune thrombocytopenia ITP based on your medical history a physical exam and test results. Your doctor will want to make sure that your low platelet count is not due to another condition such as an infection or medicines you are taking such as chemotherapy medicines or aspirin. Medical History Your doctor may ask about Your signs and symptoms of bleeding and any other signs or symptoms you are having Whether you have illnesses that could lower your platelet count or cause bleeding Medicines or any over-the-counter supplements or remedies you take that could cause bleeding or lower your platelet count Physical Exam During a physical exam your doctor will look for signs of bleeding and infection. For example your doctor may look for purplish areas on the skin or mucous membranes and pinpoint red spots on the skin. These are signs of bleeding under the skin. Diagnostic Tests You will likely have blood tests to check your platelet count. These tests usually include A complete blood count. This test checks the number of red blood cells white blood cells and platelets in your blood. In ITP the red and white blood cell counts are normal but the platelet count is low. A blood smear. For this test some of your blood is put on a slide. A microscope is used to look at your platelets and other blood cells. You also may have a blood test to check for the antibodies proteins that attack platelets. If blood tests show that your platelet count is low your doctor may recommend more tests to confirm a diagnosis of ITP. For example bone marrow tests can show whether your bone marrow is making enough platelets. If you are at risk for HIV hepatitis C or H. pylori your doctor may screen you for these infections which might be linked to ITP. Some people who have mild ITP have few or no signs of bleeding. They may be diagnosed only if a blood test done for another reason shows that they have low platelet counts."

        "output": "People at greatest risk for metabolic syndrome have these underlying causes Abdominal obesity a large waistline An inactive lifestyle Insulin resistance Some people are at risk for metabolic syndrome because they take medicines that cause weight gain or changes in blood pressure blood cholesterol and blood sugar levels. These medicines most often are used to treat inflammation allergies HIV and depression and other types of mental illness. Populations Affected Some racial and ethnic groups in the United States are at higher risk for metabolic syndrome than others. Mexican Americans have the highest rate of metabolic syndrome followed by whites and blacks. Other groups at increased risk for metabolic syndrome include People who have a personal history of diabetes People who have a sibling or parent who hasdiabetes Women when compared with men Women who have a personal history of polycystic ovarian syndrome a tendency to develop cysts on the ovaries Heart Disease Risk Metabolic syndrome increases your risk for coronary heart disease. Other risk factors besides metabolic syndrome also increase your risk for heart disease. For example a high LDL bad cholesterol level and smoking are major risk factors for heart disease. For details about all of the risk factors for heart disease go to the Coronary Heart Disease Risk Factors HealthTopic. Even if you dont have metabolic syndrome you should find out your short-term risk for heart disease. The National Cholesterol Education Program NCEP divides short-term heart disease risk into four categories. Your risk category depends on which risk factors you have and how many you have. Your risk factors are used to calculate your 10-year risk of developing heart disease. The NCEP has an online calculator that you can use to estimate your 10-year risk of having a heart attack. High risk Youre in this category if you already have heart disease or diabetes or if your 10-year risk score is more than 20 percent. Moderately high risk Youre in this category if you have two or more risk factors and your 10-year risk score is 10 percent to 20 percent. Moderate risk Youre in this category if you have two or more risk factors and your 10-year risk score is less than 10 percent. Lower risk Youre in this category if you have zero or one risk factor. Even if your 10-year risk score isnt high metabolic syndrome will increase your risk for coronary heart disease over time."

        "instruction": "What causes Pernicious Anemia ",
        "output": "Pernicious anemia is caused by a lack of intrinsic factor or other causes such as infections surgery medicines or diet. Lack of Intrinsic Factor Intrinsic factor is a protein made in the stomach. It helps your body absorb vitamin B12. In some people an autoimmune response causes a lack of intrinsic factor. An autoimmune response occurs if the bodys immune system makes antibodies proteins that mistakenly attack and damage the body is tissues or cells. In pernicious anemia the body makes antibodies that attack and destroy the parietal pa-RI-eh-tal cells. These cells line the stomach and make intrinsic factor. Why this autoimmune response occurs is not known. As a result of this attack the stomach stops making intrinsic factor. Without intrinsic factor your body can not move vitamin B12 through the small intestine where it is absorbed. This leads to vitamin B12 deficiency. A lack of intrinsic factor also can occur if you have had part or all of your stomach surgically removed. This type of surgery reduces the number of parietal cells available to make intrinsic factor. Rarely children are born with an inherited disorder that prevents their bodies from making intrinsic factor. This disorder is called congenital pernicious anemia. Other Causes Pernicious anemia also has other causes besides a lack of intrinsic factor. Malabsorption in the small intestine and a diet lacking vitamin B12 both can lead to pernicious anemia. Malabsorption in the Small Intestine Sometimes pernicious anemia occurs because the body is small intestine can not properly absorb vitamin B12. This may be the result of Too many of the wrong kind of bacteria in the small intestine. This is a common cause of pernicious anemia in older adults. The bacteria use up the available vitamin B12 before the small intestine can absorb it. Diseases that interfere with vitamin B12 absorption. One example is celiac disease. This is a genetic disorder in which your body can not tolerate a protein called gluten. Another example is Crohn is disease an inflammatory bowel disease. HIV also may interfere with vitamin B12 absorption. Certain medicines that alter bacterial growth or prevent the small intestine from properly absorbing vitamin B12. Examples include antibiotics and certain diabetes and seizure medicines. Surgical removal of part or all of the small intestine. A tapeworm infection. The tapeworm feeds off of the vitamin B12. Eating undercooked infected fish may cause this type of infection. Diet Lacking Vitamin B12 Some people get pernicious anemia because they do not have enough vitamin B12 in their diets. This cause of pernicious anemia is less common than other causes. Good food sources of vitamin B12 include Breakfast cereals with added vitamin B12 Meats such as beef liver poultry and fish Eggs and dairy products such as milk yogurt and cheese Foods fortified with vitamin B12 such as soy-based beverages and vegetarian burgers Strict vegetarians who do not eat any animal or dairy products and do not take a vitamin B12 supplement are at risk for pernicious anemia. Breastfed infants of strict vegetarian mothers also are at risk for pernicious anemia. These infants can develop anemia within months of being born. This is because they have not had enough time to store vitamin B12 in their bodies. Doctors treat these infants with vitamin B12 supplements. Other groups such as the elderly and people who suffer from alcoholism also may be at risk for pernicious anemia. These people may not get the proper nutrients in their diets."

        "output": "Pernicious anemia is more common in people of Northern European and African descent than in other ethnic groups. Older people also are at higher risk for the condition. This is mainly due to a lack of stomach acid and intrinsic factor which prevents the small intestine from absorbing vitamin B12. As people grow older they tend to make less stomach acid. Pernicious anemia also can occur in younger people and other populations. You are at higher risk for pernicious anemia if you Have a family history of the condition. Have had part or all of your stomach surgically removed. The stomach makes intrinsic factor. This protein helps your body absorb vitamin B12. Have an autoimmune disorder that involves the endocrine glands such as Addison is disease type 1 diabetes Graves disease or vitiligo. Research suggests a link may exist between these autoimmune disorders and pernicious anemia that is caused by an autoimmune response. Have had part or all of your small intestine surgically removed. The small intestine is where vitamin B12 is absorbed. Have certain intestinal diseases or other disorders that may prevent your body from properly absorbing vitamin B12. Examples include Crohn is disease intestinal infections and HIV. Take medicines that prevent your body from properly absorbing vitamin B12.

        "output": "Pneumonia nu-MO-ne-ah is an infection in one or both of the lungs. Many germssuch as bacteria viruses and fungican cause pneumonia. The infection inflames your lungs air sacs which are called alveoli al-VEE-uhl-eye. The air sacs may fill up with fluid or pus causing symptoms such as a cough with phlegm a slimy substance fever chills and trouble breathing. Overview Pneumonia and its symptoms can vary from mild to severe. Many factors affect how serious pneumonia is such as the type of germ causing the infection and your age and overall health. Pneumonia tends to be more serious for Infants and young children. Older adults people 65 years or older. People who have other health problems such as heart failure diabetes or COPD chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. People who have weak immune systems as a result of diseases or other factors. Examples of these diseases and factors include HIVAIDS chemotherapy a treatment for cancer and an organ transplant or blood and marrow stem cell transplant. Outlook Pneumonia is common in the United States. Treatment for pneumonia depends on its cause how severe your symptoms are and your age and overall health. Many people can be treated at home often with oral antibiotics. Children usually start to feel better in 1 to 2 days. For adults it usually takes 2 to 3 days. Anyone who has worsening symptoms should see a doctor. People who have severe symptoms or underlying health problems may need treatment in a hospital. It may take 3 weeks or more before they can go back to their normal routines. Fatigue tiredness from pneumonia can last for a month or more."

Most of the time the body filters germs out of the air that we breathe to protect the lungs from infection. Your immune system the shape of your nose and throat your ability to cough and fine hair-like structures called cilia SIL-e-ah help stop the germs from reaching your lungs. For more information go to the Diseases and Conditions Index How the Lungs Work article. Sometimes though germs manage to enter the lungs and cause infections. This is more likely to occur if Your immune system is weak A germ is very strong Your body fails to filter germs out of the air that you breathe For example if you can not cough because you have had a stroke or are sedated germs may remain in your airways. Sedated means you are given medicine to make you sleepy. When germs reach your lungs your immune system goes into action. It sends many kinds of cells to attack the germs. These cells cause the alveoli air sacs to become red and inflamed and to fill up with fluid and pus. This causes the symptoms of pneumonia. Germs That Can Cause Pneumonia Bacteria Bacteria are the most common cause of pneumonia in adults. Some people especially the elderly and those who are disabled may get bacterial pneumonia after having the flu or even a common cold. Many types of bacteria can cause pneumonia. Bacterial pneumonia can occur on its own or develop after you have had a cold or the flu. This type of pneumonia often affects one lobe or area of a lung. When this happens the condition is called lobar pneumonia. The most common cause of pneumonia in the United States is the bacterium Streptococcus strep-to-KOK-us pneumoniae or pneumococcus nu-mo-KOK-us. Lobar Pneumonia Another type of bacterial pneumonia is called atypical pneumonia. Atypical pneumonia includes Legionella pneumophila. This type of pneumonia sometimes is called Legionnaire is disease and it has caused serious outbreaks. Outbreaks have been linked to exposure to cooling towers whirlpool spas and decorative fountains. Mycoplasma pneumonia. This is a common type of pneumonia that usually affects people younger than 40 years old. People who live or work in crowded places like schools homeless shelters and prisons are at higher risk for this type of pneumonia. It is usually mild and responds well to treatment with antibiotics. However mycoplasma pneumonia can be very serious. It may be associated with a skin rash and hemolysis the breakdown of red blood cells. Chlamydophila pneumoniae. This type of pneumonia can occur all year and often is mild. The infection is most common in people 65 to 79 years old. Viruses Respiratory viruses cause up to one-third of the pneumonia cases in the United States each year. These viruses are the most common cause of pneumonia in children younger than 5 years old. Most cases of viral pneumonia are mild. They get better in about 1 to 3 weeks without treatment. Some cases are more serious and may require treatment in a hospital. If you have viral pneumonia you run the risk of getting bacterial pneumonia as well. The flu virus is the most common cause of viral pneumonia in adults. Other viruses that cause pneumonia include respiratory syncytial virus rhinovirus herpes simplex virus severe acute respiratory syndrome SARS and more. Fungi Three types of fungi in the soil in some parts of the United States can cause pneumonia. These fungi are Coccidioidomycosis kok-sid-e-OY-do-mi-KO-sis. This fungus is found in Southern California and the desert Southwest. Histoplasmosis HIS-to-plaz-MO-sis. This fungus is found in the Ohio and Mississippi River Valleys. Cryptococcus krip-to-KOK-us. This fungus is found throughout the United States in bird droppings and soil contaminated with bird droppings. Most people exposed to these fungi do not get sick but some do and require treatment. Serious fungal infections are most common in people who have weak immune systems due to the long-term use of medicines to suppress their immune systems or having HIVAIDS. Pneumocystis jiroveci nu-mo-SIS-tis ye-RO-VECH-e formerly Pneumocystis carinii sometimes is considered a fungal pneumonia. However it is not treated with the usual antifungal medicines.

However two age groups are at greater risk of developing pneumonia Infants who are 2 years old or younger because their immune systems are still developing during the first few years of life People who are 65 years old or older Other conditions and factors also raise your risk for pneumonia. You are more likely to get pneumonia if you have a lung disease or other serious disease. Examples include cystic fibrosis asthma COPD chronic obstructive pulmonary disease bronchiectasis diabetes heart failure and sickle cell anemia. You are at greater risk for pneumonia if you are in a hospital intensive-care unit especially if you are on a ventilator a machine that helps you breathe. Having a weak or suppressed immune system also raises your risk for pneumonia. A weak immune system may be the result of a disease such as HIVAIDS. A suppressed immune system may be due to an organ transplant or blood and marrow stem cell transplant chemotherapy a treatment for cancer or long-term steroid use. Your risk for pneumonia also increases if you have trouble coughing because of a stroke or problems swallowing. You are also at higher risk if you can not move around much or are sedated given medicine to make you relaxed or sleepy. Smoking cigarettes abusing alcohol or being undernourished also raises your risk for pneumonia.

Influenza Vaccine The vaccine that helps prevent the flu is good for 1 year. It is usually given in October or November before peak flu season. Because many people get pneumonia after having the flu this vaccine also helps prevent pneumonia. For more information about the influenza vaccine go to the CDC is Vaccines and Preventable Diseases Seasonal Influenza Flu Vaccination Web page. Hib Vaccine Haemophilus influenzae type b Hib is a type of bacteria that can cause pneumonia and meningitis men-in-JI-tis. Meningitis is an infection of the covering of the brain and spinal cord.

Other Ways To Help Prevent Pneumonia You also can take the following steps to help prevent pneumonia Wash your hands with soap and water or alcohol-based rubs to kill germs. Do not smoke. Smoking damages your lungs ability to filter out and defend against germs. For information about how to quit smoking go to the Health Topics Smoking and Your Heart article. Although this resource focuses on heart health it includes general information about how to quit smoking. Keep your immune system strong. Get plenty of rest and physical activity and follow a healthy diet. If you have pneumonia limit contact with family and friends. Cover your nose and mouth while coughing or sneezing and get rid of used tissues right away. These actions help keep the infection from spreading."

        "output": "Pulmonary hypertension PH begins with inflammation and changes in the cells that line your pulmonary arteries. Other factors also can affect the pulmonary arteries and cause PH. For example the condition may develop if The walls of the arteries tighten. The walls of the arteries are stiff at birth or become stiff from an overgrowth of cells. Blood clots form in the arteries. These changes make it hard for your heart to push blood through your pulmonary arteries and into your lungs. Thus the pressure in the arteries rises causing PH. Many factors can contribute to the process that leads to the different types of PH. Group 1 pulmonary arterial hypertension PAH may have no known cause or the condition may be inherited. Inherited means the condition is passed from parents to children through genes. Some diseases and conditions also can cause group 1 PAH. Examples include HIV infection congenital heart disease and sickle cell disease. Also the use of street drugs such as cocaine and certain diet medicines can lead to PAH. Many diseases and conditions can cause groups 2 through 5 PH often called secondary PH including Mitral valve disease Lung diseases such as COPD chronic obstructive pulmonary disease Sleep apnea Sarcoidosis For more information about the types of PH and the diseases conditions and factors that can cause them go to Types of Pulmonary Hypertension."

        "instruction": "How to diagnose Pulmonary Hypertension ",
        "output": "Your doctor will diagnose pulmonary hypertension PH based on your medical and family histories a physical exam and the results from tests and procedures. PH can develop slowly. In fact you may have it for years and not know it. This is because the condition has no early signs or symptoms. When symptoms do occur they are often like those of other heart and lung conditions such as asthma. This makes PH hard to diagnose. Medical and Family Histories Your doctor may ask about your signs and symptoms and how and when they began. He or she also may ask whether you have other medical conditions that can cause PH. Your doctor will want to know whether you have any family members who have or have had PH. People who have a family history of PH are at higher risk for the condition. Physical Exam During the physical exam your doctor will listen to your heart and lungs with a stethoscope. He or she also will check your ankles and legs for swelling and your lips and skin for a bluish color. These are signs of PH. Diagnostic Tests and Procedures Your doctor may recommend tests and procedures to confirm a diagnosis of PH and to look for its underlying cause. Your doctor also will use test results to find out the severity of your PH. Tests and Procedures To Confirm a Diagnosis Echocardiography. Echocardiography EK-o-kar-de-OG-ra-fee or echo uses sound waves to create a moving picture of your heart. This test can estimate the pressure in your pulmonary arteries. Echo also can show the size and thickness of your right ventricle and how well it is working. Chest x ray. A chest x ray takes pictures of the structures in your chest such as your heart lungs and blood vessels. This test can show whether your pulmonary arteries and right ventricle are enlarged. The pulmonary arteries and right ventricle may get larger if the right ventricle has to work hard to pump blood through the pulmonary arteries. A chest x ray also may show signs of an underlying lung disease that is causing or contributing to PH. EKG electrocardiogram. An EKG is a simple painless test that records the heart is electrical activity. This test also shows whether your heart is rhythm is steady or irregular. An EKG may show whether your right ventricle is enlarged or strained. Right heart catheterization. This procedure measures the pressure in your pulmonary arteries. It also shows how well your heart is pumping blood to the rest of your body. Right heart catheterization KATH-e-ter-ih-ZA-shun can find any leaks between the left and right side of the heart. During this procedure a thin flexible tube called a catheter is put into a blood vessel in your groin upper thigh or neck. The tube is threaded into the right side of your heart and into the pulmonary arteries. Through the tube your doctor can do tests and treatments on your heart. Tests To Look for the Underlying Cause of Pulmonary Hypertension PH has many causes so many tests may need to be done to find its underlying cause. Chest CT scan. A chest computed tomography to-MOG-ra-fee scan or chest CT scan creates pictures of the structures inside your chest such as your heart lungs and blood vessels. These pictures can show signs of PH or a condition that may be causing PH. Chest MRI. Chest magnetic resonance imaging or chest MRI shows how your right ventricle is working. The test also shows blood flow in your lungs. Chest MRI also can help detect signs of PH or an underlying condition causing PH. Lung function tests. Lung function tests measure how much air you can breathe in and out how fast you can breathe air out and how well your lungs deliver oxygen to your blood. These tests can help detect a lung disease that may be causing PH. Polysomnogram PSG. This test records brain activity eye movements heart rate and blood pressure while you sleep. A PSG also measures the level of oxygen in your blood. A low oxygen level during sleep is common in PH and it can make the condition worse. A PSG usually is done while you stay overnight at a sleep center. For more information about this test go to the Diseases and Conditions Index Sleep Studies article. Lung ventilationperfusion VQ scan. A lung VQ scan measures air and blood flow in your lungs. This test can help detect blood clots in your lung is blood vessels. Blood tests. Blood tests are used to rule out other diseases such as HIV liver disease and autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. Finding Out the Severity of Pulmonary Hypertension Exercise testing is used to find out the severity of PH. This testing consists of either a 6-minute walk test or a cardiopulmonary exercise test. A 6-minute walk test measures the distance you can quickly walk in 6 minutes. A cardiopulmonary exercise test measures how well your lungs and heart work while you exercise on a treadmill or bicycle. During exercise testing your doctor will rate your activity level. Your level is linked to the severity of your PH. The rating system ranges from class 1 to class 4. Class 1 has no limits. You can do regular physical activities such as walking or climbing stairs. These activities do not cause PH symptoms such as tiredness shortness of breath or chest pain. Class 2 has slight or mild limits. You are comfortable while resting but regular physical activity causes PH symptoms. Class 3 has marked or noticeable limits. You are comfortable while resting. However walking even one or two blocks or climbing one flight of stairs can cause PH symptoms. Class 4 has severe limits. You are not able to do any physical activity without discomfort. You also may have PH symptoms while at rest. Over time you may need more exercise tests to find out how well your treatments are working. Each time testing is done your doctor will compare your activity level with the previous one."

The clots can limit or block the flow of oxygen-rich blood to the body is organs such as the brain kidneys and heart. As a result serious health problems can develop. The increased clotting that occurs in TTP also uses up platelets PLATE-lets in the blood. Platelets are blood cell fragments that help form blood clots. These cell fragments stick together to seal small cuts and breaks on blood vessel walls and stop bleeding. With fewer platelets available in the blood bleeding problems can occur. People who have TTP may bleed inside their bodies underneath the skin or from the surface of the skin. When cut or injured they also may bleed longer than normal. Thrombotic throm-BOT-ik refers to the blood clots that form. Thrombocytopenic throm-bo-cy-toe-PEE-nick means the blood has a lower than normal number of platelets. Purpura PURR-purr-ah refers to purple bruises caused by bleeding under the skin. Bleeding under the skin also can cause tiny red or purple dots on the skin. These pinpoint-sized dots are called petechiae peh-TEE-kee-ay. Petechiae may look like a rash. Purpura and Petechiae TTP also can cause red blood cells to break apart faster than the body can replace them. This leads to hemolytic anemia HEE-moh-lit-ick uh-NEE-me-uha rare form of anemia. Anemia is a condition in which the body has a lower than normal number of red blood cells. A lack of activity in the ADAMTS13 enzyme a type of protein in the blood causes TTP. The ADAMTS13 gene controls the enzyme which is involved in blood clotting. The enzyme breaks up a large protein called von Willebrand factor that clumps together with platelets to form blood clots. Types of Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura The two main types of TTP are inherited and acquired. Inherited means the condition is passed from parents to children through genes. This type of TTP mainly affects newborns and children. In inherited TTP the ADAMTS13 gene is faulty and does not prompt the body to make a normal ADAMTS13 enzyme. As a result enzyme activity is lacking or changed. Acquired TTP is the more common type of the disorder. Acquired means you are not born with the disorder but you develop it. This type of TTP mostly occurs in adults but it can affect children. In acquired TTP the ADAMTS13 gene is not faulty. Instead the body makes antibodies proteins that block the activity of the ADAMTS13 enzyme. It is not clear what triggers inherited and acquired TTP but some factors may play a role. These factors may include Some diseases and conditions such as pregnancy cancer HIV lupus and infections Some medical procedures such as surgery and blood and marrow stem cell transplant Some medicines such as chemotherapy ticlopidine clopidogrel cyclosporine A and hormone therapy and estrogens Quinine which is a substance often found in tonic water and nutritional health products If you have TTP you may sometimes hear it referred to as TTPHUS. HUS or hemolytic-uremic syndrome is a disorder that resembles TTP but is more common in children. Kidney problems also tend to be worse in HUS. Although some researchers think TTP and HUS are two forms of a single syndrome recent evidence suggests that each has different causes. Outlook TTP is a rare disorder. It can be fatal or cause lasting damage such as brain damage or a stroke if it is not treated right away. TTP usually occurs suddenly and lasts for days or weeks but it can continue for months. Relapses or flareups can occur in up to 60 percent of people who have the acquired type of TTP. Many people who have inherited TTP have frequent flareups that need to be treated. Treatments for TTP include infusions of fresh frozen plasma and plasma exchange also called plasmapheresis PLAZ-ma-feh-RE-sis. These treatments have greatly improved the outlook of the disorder."

Acquired means you are not born with the condition but you develop it sometime after birth. Triggers for Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura It is unclear what triggers inherited and acquired TTP but some factors may play a role. These factors may include Some diseases and conditions such as pregnancy cancer HIV lupus and infections Some medical procedures such as surgery and blood and marrow stem cell transplant Some medicines such as chemotherapy ticlopidine clopidogrel cyclosporine A and hormone therapy and estrogens Quinine which is a substance often found in tonic water and nutritional health products"

        "output": "Your doctor will diagnosis thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura TTP based on your medical history a physical exam and test results. If TTP is suspected or diagnosed a hematologist will be involved in your care. A hematologist is a doctor who specializes in diagnosing and treating blood disorders. Medical History Your doctor will ask about factors that may affect TTP. For example he or she may ask whether you Have certain diseases or conditions such as cancer HIV lupus or infections or whether you are pregnant. Have had previous medical procedures such as a blood and marrow stem cell transplant. Take certain medicines such as ticlopidine clopidogrel cyclosporine A or hormone therapy and estrogens or whether you have had chemotherapy. Have used any products that contain quinine. Quinine is a substance often found in tonic water and nutritional health products. Physical Exam As part of the medical history and physical exam your doctor will ask about any signs or symptoms you have had. He or she will look for signs such as Bruising and bleeding under your skin Fever Paleness or jaundice a yellowish color of the skin or whites of the eyes A fast heart rate Speech changes or changes in awareness that can range from confusion to passing out Changes in urine Diagnostic Tests Your doctor also may recommend tests to help find out whether you have TTP. Complete Blood Count This test measures the number of red blood cells white blood cells and platelets in your blood. For this test a sample of blood is drawn from a vein usually in your arm. If you have TTP you will have a lower than normal number of platelets and red blood cells anemia. Blood Smear For this test a sample of blood is drawn from a vein usually in your arm. Some of your blood is put on a glass slide. A microscope is then used to look at your red blood cells. In TTP the red blood cells are torn and broken. Platelet Count This test counts the number of platelets in a blood smear. People who have TTP have a lower than normal number of platelets in their blood. This test is used with the blood smear to help diagnose TTP. Bilirubin Test When red blood cells die they release a protein called hemoglobin HEE-muh-glow-bin into the bloodstream. The body breaks down hemoglobin into a compound called bilirubin. High levels of bilirubin in the bloodstream cause jaundice. For this blood test a sample of blood is drawn from a vein usually in your arm. The level of bilirubin in the sample is checked. If you have TTP your bilirubin level may be high because your body is breaking down red blood cells faster than normal. Kidney Function Tests and Urine Tests These tests show whether your kidneys are working well. If you have TTP your urine may contain protein or blood cells. Also your blood creatinine kre-AT-ih-neen level may be high. Creatinine is a blood product that is normally removed by the kidneys. Coombs Test This blood test is used to find out whether TTP is the cause of hemolytic anemia. For this test a sample of blood is drawn from a vein usually in your arm. In TTP hemolytic anemia occurs because red blood cells are broken into pieces as they try to squeeze around blood clots. When TTP is the cause of hemolytic anemia the Coombs test is negative. The test is positive if antibodies proteins are destroying your red blood cells. Lactate Dehydrogenase Test This blood test measures a protein called lactate dehydrogenase LDH. For this test a sample of blood is drawn from a vein usually in your arm. Hemolytic anemia causes red blood cells to break down and release LDH into the blood. LDH also is released from tissues that are injured by blood clots as a result of TTP. ADAMTS13 Assay A lack of activity in the ADAMTS13 enzyme causes TTP. For this test a sample of blood is drawn from a vein usually in your arm. The blood is sent to a special lab to test for the enzyme is activity."

        "instruction": "What are the symptoms of Anaplasmosis ",
        "output": "Anaplasmosis is a disease caused by the bacterium Anaplasma phagocytophilium. This pathogen is transmitted to humans by the bite of an infected tick. The black-legged tick Ixodes scapularis is the vector of A. phagocytophilum in the northeast and upper midwestern United States. The western black-legged tick Ixodes pacificus is the primary vector in Northern California. The first symptoms of anaplasmosis typically begin within 1-2 weeks after the bite of an infected tick. A tick bite is usually painless and some patients who develop anaplasmosis do not remember being bitten. The following is a list of symptoms commonly seen with this disease. However it is important to note that few people with the disease will develop all symptoms and the number and combination of symptoms varies greatly from person to person. - Fever - Headache - Muscle pain - Malaise - Chills - Nausea  Abdominal pain - Cough - Confusion - Rash rare with anaplasmosis Anaplasmosis can be a serious illness that can be fatal if not treated correctly even in previously healthy people. Severe clinical presentations may include difficulty breathing hemorrhage renal failure or neurological problems. The estimated case fatality rate i.e. the proportion of persons who die as a result of their infection is less than 1. Patients who are treated early may recover quickly on outpatient medication while those who experience a more severe course may require intravenous antibiotics prolonged hospitalization or intensive care. Rash Rash is rarely reported in patients with anaplasmosis and the presence of a rash may signify that the patient has a coinfection with the pathogen that causes Lyme disease or another tickborne disease such as Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever . Immune-compromised Individuals The severity of anaplasmosis may depend in part on the immune status of the patient. Persons with compromised immunity caused by immunosuppressive therapies e.g. corticosteroids cancer chemotherapy or longterm immunosuppressive therapy following organ transplant HIV infection or splenectomy appear to develop more severe disease and case-fatality rates for these individuals are characteristically higher than case-fatality rates reported for the general population. Blood Transfusion and Organ Transplant Risks Associated with Anaplasma species Because A. phagocytophilum infects the white blood cells and circulates in the blood stream this pathogen may pose a risk to be transmitted through blood transfusions. Anaplasma phagocytophilum has been shown to survive for more than a week in refrigerated blood. Several cases of anaplasmosis have been reported associated with the transfusion of packed red blood cells donated from asymptomatic or acutely infected donors. Patients who develop anaplasmosis within a month of receiving a blood transfusion or solid organ transplant should be reported to state health officials for prompt investigation. Use of leukoreduced blood products may theoretically decrease the risk of transfusion-associated transmission of these pathogens. However the filtration process does not remove all leukocytes or bacteria not associated with leukocytes from leukoreduced blood. Therefore while this process may reduce the risk of transmission it does not eliminate it completely. Physician Diagnosis There are several aspects of anaplasmosis that make it challenging for healthcare providers to diagnose and treat. The symptoms vary from patient to patient and can be difficult to distinguish from other diseases. Treatment is more likely to be effective if started early in the course of disease. Diagnostic tests based on the detection of antibodies will frequently appear negative in the first 7-10 days of illness. For this reason healthcare providers must use their judgment to treat patients based on clinical suspicion alone. Healthcare providers may find important information in the patient is history and physical examination that may aid clinical diagnosis. Information such as recent tick bites exposure to areas where ticks are likely to be found or history of recent travel to areas where anaplasmosis is endemic can be helpful in making the diagnosis. The healthcare provider should also look at routine blood tests such as a complete blood cell count or a chemistry panel. Clues such as a low platelet count thrombocytopenia low white blood cell count leukopenia or elevated liver enzyme levels are helpful predictors of anaplasmosis but may not be present in all patients. After a suspect diagnosis is made on clinical suspicion and treatment has begun specialized laboratory testing should be used to confirm the diagnosis of anaplasmosis. Laboratory Detection During the acute phase of illness a sample of whole blood can be tested by polymerase chain reaction PCR assay to determine if a patient has anaplasmosis. This method is most sensitive in the first week of illness and rapidly decreases in sensitivity following the administration of appropriate antibiotics. Although a positive PCR result is helpful a negative result does not completely rule out the diagnosis and treatment should not be with held due to a negative result. During the first week of illness a microscopic examination of blood smears known as a peripheral blood smear may reveal morulae microcolonies of anaplasma in the cytoplasm of white blood cells in up to 20 of patients. During A. phagocytophilum infection morulae are most frequently observed in granulocytes. However the observance of morulae in a particular cell type cannot conclusively identify the infecting species. Culture isolation of A. phagocytophilum is only available at specialized laboratories routine hospital blood cultures cannot detect the organism. Figure 1 Morulae detected in a granulocyte on a peripheral blood smear associated with A. phagocytophilum infection. When a person develops anaplasmosis their immune system produces antibodies to A. phagocytophilum with detectable antibody titers usually observed by 7-10 days after illness onset. It is important to note that a negative test during the first week of illness does not rule out anaplasmosis as a cause of illness. The gold standard serologic test for diagnosis of anaplasmosis is the indirect immunofluorescence assay IFA using A. phagocytophilum antigen performed on paired serum samples to demonstrate a significant four-fold rise in antibody titers. The first sample should be taken as early in the disease as possible preferably in the first week of symptoms and the second sample should be taken 2 to 4 weeks later. In most cases of anaplasmosis the first IgG IFA titer is typically low or \u201cnegative\u201d and the second typically shows a significant four-fold increase in IgG antibody levels. IgM antibodies usually rise at the same time as IgG near the end of the first week of illness and remain elevated for months or longer. Also IgM antibodies are less specific than IgG antibodies and more likely to result in a false positive. For these reasons physicians requesting IgM serologic titers should also request a concurrent IgG titer. Serologic tests based on enzyme immunoassay EIA technology are available from some commercial laboratories. However EIA tests are qualitative rather than quantitative meaning they only provide a positivenegative result and are less useful to measure changes in antibody titers between paired specimens. Furthermore some EIA assays rely on the evaluation of IgM antibody alone which may have a higher frequency of false positive results. Antibodies to A. phagocytophilum may remain elevated for months or longer after the disease has resolved or may be detected in persons who were previously exposed to antigenically related organisms. Between 5-10 of currently healthy people in some areas may have elevated antibody titers due to past exposure to A. phagocytophilum or similar organisms. Therefore if only one sample is tested it can be difficult to interpret while paired samples taken weeks apart demonstrating a significant four-fold rise in antibody titer provides the best evidence for a correct diagnosis of anaplasmosis. For more in-depth information about the diagnosis of anaplasmosis please visit httpwww.cdc.govmmwrpreviewmmwrhtmlrr5504a1.htm Treatment Doxycycline is the first line treatment for adults and children of all ages and should be initiated immediately whenever anaplasmosis is suspected. Use of antibiotics other than doxycycline or other tetracyclines has been associated with a higher risk of fatal outcome for some rickettsial infections. Doxycycline is most effective at preventing severe complications from developing if it is started early in the course of disease. Therefore treatment must be based on clinical suspicion alone and should always begin before laboratory results return. If the patient is treated within the first 5 days of the disease fever generally subsides within 24-72 hours. In fact failure to respond to doxycycline suggests that the patient is condition might not be due to anaplasmosis. Severely ill patients may require longer periods before their fever resolves. Resistance to doxcycline or relapses in symptoms after the completion of the recommended course have not been documented. Recommended Dosage Doxycycline is the first line treatment for adults and children of all ages - Adults 100 mg every 12 hours - Children under 45 kg 100 lbs 2.2 mgkg body weight given twice a day Patients should be treated for at least 3 days after the fever subsides and until there is evidence of clinical improvement. Standard duration of treatment is 7 to 14 days. Some patients may continue to experience headache weakness and malaise for weeks after adequate treatment. Treating children The use of doxycycline to treat suspected anaplasmosis in children is standard practice recommended by both CDC and the AAP Committee on Infectious Diseases. Unlike older generations of tetracyclines the recommended dose and duration of medication needed to treat anaplasmosis has not been shown to cause staining of permanent teeth even when five courses are given before the age of eight. Healthcare providers should use doxycycline as the first-line treatment for suspected anaplasmosis in patients of all ages. Other Treatments In cases of life threatening allergies to doxycycline and in some pregnant patients for whom the clinical course of anaplasmosis appears mild physicians may need to consider alternate antibiotics. Although recommended as a second-line therapeutic alternative to treat Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever  chloramphenicol is not recommended for the treatment of anaplasmosis as studies have shown a lack of efficacy. Rifampin has been used successfully in several pregnant women with anaplasmosis and studies suggest that this drug appears effective against Anaplasma species. However rifampin is not effective in treating RMSF a disease that may be confused with anaplasmosis. Healthcare providers should be cautious when exploring treatments other than doxycycline which is highly effective in treating both. Other antibiotics including broad spectrum antibiotics are not considered highly effective against A. phagocytophilum and the use of sulfa drugs during acute illness may worsen the severity of infection. Prophylaxis Preventive Treatment Antibiotic treatment following a tick bite is not recommended as a means to prevent anaplasmosis. There is no evidence this practice is effective and this may simply delay onset of disease. Instead persons who experience a tick bite should be alert for symptoms suggestive of tickborne illness and consult a physician if fever rash or other symptoms of concern develop. For more in-depth information about treatment please visit httpwww.cdc.govmmwrpreviewmmwrhtmlrr5504a1.htm Other Considerations The clinical presentation for anaplasmosis can resemble other tickborne diseases such as Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever and ehrlichiosis. Similar to anaplasmosis these infections respond well to treatment with doxycycline. Healthcare providers should order diagnostic tests for additional agents if the clinical history and geographic association warrant.

        "instruction": "What are the symptoms of Ehrlichiosis ",
        "output": "Symptoms In the United States the term \u201cehrlichiosis\u201d may be broadly applied to several different infections. Ehrlichia chaffeensis and Ehrlichia ewingii are transmitted by the lonestar tick in the southeastern and southcentral United States. In addition a third Ehrlichia species provisionally called Ehrlichia muris-like EML has been identified in a small number of patients residing in or traveling to Minnesota and Wisconsin a tick vector for the EML organism has not yet been established. The symptoms caused by infection with these Ehrlichia species usually develop 1-2 weeks after being bitten by an infected tick. The tick bite is usually painless and about half of the people who develop ehrlichiosis may not even remember being bitten by a tick. The following is a list of symptoms commonly seen with this disease however it is important to note that the combination of symptoms varies greatly from person to person. - Fever - Headache - Chills - Malaise - Muscle pain - Nausea  Vomiting  Diarrhea - Confusion - Conjunctival injection red eyes - Rash in up to 60 of children less than 30 of adults Ehrlichiosis is a serious illness that can be fatal if not treated correctly even in previously healthy people. Severe clinical presentations may include difficulty breathing or bleeding disorders. The estimated case fatality rate i.e. the proportion of persons who die as a result of their infection is 1.8. Patients who are treated early may recover quickly on outpatient medication while those who experience a more severe course may require intravenous antibiotics prolonged hospitalization or intensive care. Rash Skin rash is not considered a common feature of ehrlichiosis and should not be used to rule in or rule out an infection. Ehrlichia chaffeensis infection can cause a rash in up to 60 of children but is reported in fewer than 30 of adults. Rash is not commonly reported in patients infected with Ehrlichia ewingii or the Ehrlichia muris-like organism. The rash associated with Ehrlichia chaffeensis infection may range from maculopapular to petechial in nature and is usually not pruritic itchy. The rash usually spares the face but in some cases may spread to the palms and soles. A type of rash called erythroderma may develop in some patients. Erythroderma is a type of rash that resembles a sunburn and consists of widespread reddening of the skin that may peel after several days. Some patients may develop a rash that resembles the rash of Rocky Mountain spotted fever making these two diseases difficult to differentiate on the basis of clinical signs alone. Immune-compromised Individuals The severity of ehrlichiosis may depend in part on the immune status of the patient. Persons with compromised immunity caused by immunosuppressive therapies e.g. corticosteroids  cancer chemotherapy or longterm immunosuppressive therapy following organ transplant HIV infection or splenectomy appear to develop more severe disease and may also have higher case-fatality rates i.e. the proportion of patients that die from infection.

Ehrlichia chaffeensis has been shown to survive for more than a week in refrigerated blood. Several instances of suspected E. chaffeensis transmission through solid organ transplant have been investigated although to date no cases have been confirmed that can be attributed to this route of transmission. Patients who develop ehrlichiosis within a month of receiving a blood transfusion or solid organ transplant should be reported to state health officials for prompt investigation.

When a person develops ehrlichiosis their immune system produces antibodies to the Ehrlichia with detectable antibody titers usually observed by 7-10 days after illness onset.

        "instruction": "What are the treatments for Parasites - Lice - Head Lice ",
        "output": "General Guidelines Treatment for head lice is recommended for persons diagnosed with an active infestation. All household members and other close contacts should be checked those persons with evidence of an active infestation should be treated. Some experts believe prophylactic treatment is prudent for persons who share the same bed with actively-infested individuals. All infested persons household members and close contacts and their bedmates should be treated at the same time. Some pediculicides medicines that kill lice have an ovicidal effect kill eggs. For pediculicides that are only weakly ovicidal or not ovicidal routine retreatment is recommended. For those that are more strongly ovicidal retreatment is recommended only if live crawling lice are still present several days after treatment see recommendation for each medication. To be most effective retreatment should occur after all eggs have hatched but before new eggs are produced. When treating head lice supplemental measures can be combined with recommended medicine pharmacologic treatment however such additional non-pharmacologic measures generally are not required to eliminate a head lice infestation. For example hats scarves pillow cases bedding clothing and towels worn or used by the infested person in the 2-day period just before treatment is started can be machine washed and dried using the hot water and hot air cycles because lice and eggs are killed by exposure for 5 minutes to temperatures greater than 53.5C 128.3F. Items that cannot be laundered may be dry-cleaned or sealed in a plastic bag for two weeks. Items such as hats grooming aids and towels that come in contact with the hair of an infested person should not be shared. Vacuuming furniture and floors can remove an infested person is hairs that might have viable nits attached. Treatment of the infested persons Requires using an Over-the-counter OTC or prescription medication. Follow these treatment steps - Before applying treatment it may be helpful to remove clothing that can become wet or stained during treatment. - Apply lice medicine also called pediculicide according to the instructions contained in the box or printed on the label. If the infested person has very long hair longer than shoulder length it may be necessary to use a second bottle. Pay special attention to instructions on the label or in the box regarding how long the medication should be left on the hair and how it should be washed out. - Have the infested person put on clean clothing after treatment. - If a few live lice are still found 8\u201312 hours after treatment but are moving more slowly than before do not retreat. The medicine may take longer to kill all the lice. Comb dead and any remaining live lice out of the hair using a fine\u2013toothed nit comb. - If after 8\u201312 hours of treatment no dead lice are found and lice seem as active as before the medicine may not be working. Do not retreat until speaking with your health care provider a different pediculicide may be necessary. If your health care provider recommends a different pediculicide carefully follow the treatment instructions contained in the box or printed on the label. - Nit head lice egg combs often found in lice medicine packages should be used to comb nits and lice from the hair shaft. Many flea combs made for cats and dogs are also effective. - After each treatment checking the hair and combing with a nit comb to remove nits and lice every 2\u20133 days may decrease the chance of self\u2013reinfestation. Continue to check for 2\u20133 weeks to be sure all lice and nits are gone. Nit removal is not needed when treating with spinosad topical suspension. - Retreatment is meant to kill any surviving hatched lice before they produce new eggs. For some drugs retreatment is recommended routinely about a week after the first treatment 7\u20139 days depending on the drug and for others only if crawling lice are seen during this period. Retreatment with lindane shampoo is not recommended. Supplemental Measures Head lice do not survive long if they fall off a person and cannot feed. You do not need to spend a lot of time or money on housecleaning activities. Follow these steps to help avoid re\u2013infestation by lice that have recently fallen off the hair or crawled onto clothing or furniture. - Machine wash and dry clothing bed linens and other items that the infested person wore or used during the 2 days before treatment using the hot water 130F laundry cycle and the high heat drying cycle. Clothing and items that are not washable can be dry\u2013cleaned OR sealed in a plastic bag and stored for 2 weeks. - Soak combs and brushes in hot water at least 130F for 5\u201310 minutes. - Vacuum the floor and furniture particularly where the infested person sat or lay. However the risk of getting infested by a louse that has fallen onto a rug or carpet or furniture is very low. Head lice survive less than 1\u20132 days if they fall off a person and cannot feed nits cannot hatch and usually die within a week if they are not kept at the same temperature as that found close to the human scalp. Spending much time and money on housecleaning activities is not necessary to avoid reinfestation by lice or nits that may have fallen off the head or crawled onto furniture or clothing. - Do not use fumigant sprays they can be toxic if inhaled or absorbed through the skin. Prevent Reinfestation More on Prevention & Control Over-the-counter Medications Many head lice medications are available over-the-counter without a prescription at a local drug store or pharmacy. Each over-the-counter product approved by the FDA for the treatment of head lice contains one of the following active ingredients. If crawling lice are still seen after a full course of treatment contact your health care provider. - Pyrethrins combined with piperonyl butoxide Brand name products A\u2013200* Pronto* R&C* Rid* Triple X* Licide* Pyrethrins are naturally occurring pyrethroid extracts from the chrysanthemum flower. Pyrethrins are safe and effective when used as directed. Pyrethrins can only kill live lice not unhatched eggs nits. A second treatment is recommended 9 to 10 days after the first treatment to kill any newly hatched lice before they can produce new eggs. Pyrethrins generally should not be used by persons who are allergic to chrysanthemums or ragweed. Pyrethrin is approved for use on children 2 years of age and older. - Permethrin lotion 1 Brand name product Nix*. Permethrin is a synthetic pyrethroid similar to naturally occurring pyrethrins. Permethrin lotion 1 is approved by the FDA for the treatment of head lice. Permethrin is safe and effective when used as directed. Permethrin kills live lice but not unhatched eggs. Permethrin may continue to kill newly hatched lice for several days after treatment. A second treatment often is necessary on day 9 to kill any newly hatched lice before they can produce new eggs. Permethrin is approved for use on children 2 months of age and older. Prescription Medications The following medications in alphabetical order approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration FDA for the treatment of head lice are available only by prescription. If crawling lice are still seen after a full course of treatment contact your health care provider. - Benzyl alcohol lotion 5 Brand name product Ulesfia lotion* Benzyl alcohol is an aromatic alcohol. Benzyl alcohol lotion 5 has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of head lice and is considered safe and effective when used as directed. It kills lice but it is not ovicidali.e. does not kill lice eggs. A second treatment is needed 9 days after the first treatment to kill any newly hatched lice before they can produce new eggs. Benzyl alcohol lotion is intended for use on persons who are 6 months of age and older and its safety in persons aged more 60 years has not been established. It can be irritating to the skin. - Ivermectin lotion 0.5 Brand name product Sklice* Ivermectin lotion 0.5 was approved by the FDA in 2012 for treatment of head lice in persons 6 months of age and older. It is not ovicidal but appears to prevent nymphs newly hatched lice from surviving. It is effective in most patients when given as a single application on dry hair without nit combing. It should not be used for retreatment without talking to a healthcare provider. Given as a tablet in mass drug administrations oral ivermectin has been used extensively and safely for over two decades in many countries to treat filarial worm infections. Although not FDA-approved for the treatment of lice ivermectin tablets given in a single oral dose of 200 microgramskg repeated in 10 days or 400 microgramskg repeated in 7 days has been shown effective against head lice. It should not be used in children weighing less than 15 kg or in pregnant women. - Spinosad 0.9 topical suspension Brand name product Natroba* Spinosad is derived from soil bacteria. Spinosad topical suspension 0.9 was approved by the FDA in 2011. Since it kills live lice as well as unhatched eggs retreatment is usually not needed. Nit combing is not required. Spinosad topical suspension is approved for the treatment of children 6 months of age and older. It is safe and effective when used as directed. Repeat treatment should be given only if live crawling lice are seen 7 days after the first treatment. For second\u2013line treatment only - Lindane shampoo 1 Brand name products None available Lindane is an organochloride. The American Academy of Pediatrics AAP no longer recommends it as a pediculocide. Although lindane shampoo 1 is approved by the FDA for the treatment of head lice it is not recommended as a first\u2013line treatment. Overuse misuse or accidentally swallowing lindane can be toxic to the brain and other parts of the nervous system its use should be restricted to patients for whom prior treatments have failed or who cannot tolerate other medications that pose less risk. Lindane should not be used to treat premature infants persons with HIV a seizure disorder women who are pregnant or breast\u2013feeding persons who have very irritated skin or sores where the lindane will be applied infants children the elderly and persons who weigh less than 110 pounds. Retreatment should be avoided. When treating head lice - Do not use extra amounts of any lice medication unless instructed to do so by your physician or pharmacist. The drugs used to treat lice are insecticides and can be dangerous if they are misused or overused. - All the medications listed above should be kept out of the eyes. If they get onto the eyes they should be immediately flushed away. - Do not treat an infested person more than 2\u20133 times with the same medication if it does not seem to be working. This may be caused by using the medicine incorrectly or by resistance to the medicine. Always seek the advice of your health care provider if this should happen. Heshe may recommend an alternative medication. - Do not use different head lice drugs at the same time unless instructed to do so by your physician or pharmacist. *Use of trade names is for identification purposes only and does not imply endorsement by the Public Health Service or by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services."

        "output": "Infection Control in Health Care Settings Tuberculosis TB transmission has been documented in health care settings where health care workers and patients come in contact with people who have TB disease. People who work or receive care in health care settings are at higher risk for becoming infected with TB therefore it is necessary to have a TB infection control plan as part of a general infection control program designed to ensure the following - prompt detection of infectious patients - airborne precautions and - treatment of people who have suspected or confirmed TB disease. In order to be effective the primary emphasis of a TB infection control program should be on achieving these three goals. In all health care settings particularly those in which people are at high risk for exposure to TB policies and procedures for TB control should be developed reviewed periodically and evaluated for effectiveness to determine the actions necessary to minimize the risk for transmission of TB. The TB infection control program should be based on a three-level hierarchy of control measures and include - Administrative measures - Environmental controls - Use of respiratory protective equipment The first and most important level of the hierarchy administrative measures impacts the largest number of people. It is intended primarily to reduce the risk of uninfected people who are exposed to people who have TB disease. The second level of the hierarchy is the use of environmental controls to reduce the amount of TB in the air. The first two control levels of the hierarchy also minimize the number of areas in the health care setting where exposure to TB may occur. The third level of the hierarchy is the use of respiratory protective equipment in situations that pose a high risk of exposure to TB. Use of respiratory protection equipment can further reduce the risk for exposure of health care workers. More Information about Infection Control in Health Care Settings TB Prevention Preventing Exposure to TB Disease While Traveling Abroad Travelers should avoid close contact or prolonged time with known TB patients in crowded enclosed environments for example clinics hospitals prisons or homeless shelters. Travelers who will be working in clinics hospitals or other health care settings where TB patients are likely to be encountered should consult infection control or occupational health experts. They should ask about administrative and environmental procedures for preventing exposure to TB. Once those procedures are implemented additional measures could include using personal respiratory protective devices. Travelers who anticipate possible prolonged exposure to people with TB for example those who expect to come in contact routinely with clinic hospital prison or homeless shelter populations should have a tuberculin skin test TST or interferon-gamma release assay IGRA test before leaving the United States. If the test reaction is negative they should have a repeat test 8 to 10 weeks after returning to the United States. Additionally annual testing may be recommended for those who anticipate repeated or prolonged exposure or an extended stay over a period of years. Because people with HIV infection are more likely to have an impaired response to both the TST and IGRA travelers who are HIV positive should tell their physicians about their HIV infection status. More Tuberculosis Information for International Travelers What to Do If You Have Been Exposed to TB If you think you have been exposed to someone with TB disease contact your health care provider or local health department to see if you should be tested for TB. Be sure to tell the doctor or nurse when you spent time with someone who has TB disease. More What to Do If You Have Been Exposed to TB Preventing Latent TB Infection from Progressing to TB Disease Many people who have latent TB infection never develop TB disease. But some people who have latent TB infection are more likely to develop TB disease than others. Those at high risk for developing TB disease include - People with HIV infection - People who became infected with TB bacteria in the last 2 years - Babies and young children - People who inject illegal drugs - People who are sick with other diseases that weaken the immune system - Elderly people - People who were not treated correctly for TB in the past If you have latent TB infection and you are in one of these high-risk groups you should take medicine to keep from developing TB disease. There are several treatment options for latent TB infection. You and your health care provider must decide which treatment is best for you. If you take your medicine as instructed it can keep you from developing TB disease. Because there are less bacteria treatment for latent TB infection is much easier than treatment for TB disease. A person with TB disease has a large amount of TB bacteria in the body. Several drugs are needed to treat TB disease."

        "output": "Tuberculosis TB is caused by a bacterium called Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The bacteria usually attack the lungs but TB bacteria can attack any part of the body such as the kidney spine and brain. If not treated properly TB disease can be fatal. Not everyone infected with TB bacteria becomes sick. As a result two TB-related conditions exist latent TB infection and TB disease. Both latent TB infection and TB disease can be treated. Learn more about the difference between latent TB infection and TB disease. Treatment for Latent TB Infection People with latent TB infection have TB bacteria in their bodies but they are not sick because the bacteria are not active. People with latent TB infection do not have symptoms and they cannot spread TB bacteria to others. However if TB bacteria become active in the body and multiply the person will go from having latent TB infection to being sick with TB disease. For this reason people with latent TB infection are often prescribed treatment to prevent them from developing TB disease. Treatment of latent TB infection is essential for controlling and eliminating TB in the United States. Because there are less bacteria in a person with latent TB infection treatment is much easier. Four regimens are approved for the treatment of latent TB infection. The medications used to treat latent TB infection include - isoniazid INH - rifampin RIF - rifapentine RPT Certain groups of people such as people with weakened immune systems are at very high risk of developing TB disease once infected with TB bacteria. Every effort should be made to begin appropriate treatment and to ensure completion of the entire course of treatment for latent TB infection. More Treatment for Latent TB Infection Treatment for TB Disease TB bacteria become active multiplying in the body if the immune system can not stop them from growing. When TB bacteria are active this is called TB disease. TB disease will make a person sick. People with TB disease may spread the bacteria to people with whom they spend many hours. TB disease can be treated by taking several drugs for 6 to 9 months. There are 10 drugs currently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration FDA for treating TB. Of the approved drugs the first-line anti-TB agents that form the core of treatment regimens include - isoniazid INH - rifampin RIF - ethambutol EMB - pyrazinamide PZA Regimens for treating TB disease have an initial phase of 2 months followed by a choice of several options for the continuation phase of either 4 or 7 months total of 6 to 9 months for treatment. Learn more about the continuation phase of treatment. It is very important that people who have TB disease finish the medicine taking the drugs exactly as prescribed. If they stop taking the drugs too soon they can become sick again if they do not take the drugs correctly the TB bacteria that are still alive may become resistant to those drugs. TB that is resistant to drugs is harder and more expensive to treat. More Treatment for TB Disease Treatment Completion Treatment completion is determined by the number of doses ingested over a given period of time. Although basic TB regimens are broadly applicable there are modifications that should be made under special circumstances such as people with HIV infection drug resistance pregnancy or treatment of children."

        "output": "Central pontine myelinolysis CPM is a neurological disorder that most frequently occurs after too rapid medical correction of sodium deficiency hyponatremia. The rapid rise in sodium concentration is accompanied by the movement of small molecules and pulls water from brain cells. Through a mechanism that is only partly understood the shift in water and brain molecules leads to the destruction of myelin a substance that surrounds and protects nerve fibers. Nerve cells neurons can also be damaged. Certain areas of the brain are particularly susceptible to myelinolysis especially the part of the brain stem called the pons. Some individuals will also have damage in other areas of the brain which is called extrapontine myelinolysis EPM. Experts estimate that 10 percent of those with CPM will also have areas of EPM. The initial symptoms of myelinolysis which begin to appear 2 to 3 days after hyponatremia is corrected include a depressed level of awareness difficulty speaking dysarthria or mutism and difficulty swallowing dysphagia. Additional symptoms often arise over the next 1-2 weeks including impaired thinking weakness or paralysis in the arms and legs stiffness impaired sensation and difficulty with coordination. At its most severe myelinolysis can lead to coma locked-in syndrome which is the complete paralysis of all of the voluntary muscles in the body except for those that control the eyes and death. Although many affected people improve over weeks to months some have permanent disability. Some also develop new symptoms later including behavioral or intellectual impairment or movement disorders like parkinsonism or tremor. Anyone including adults and children who undergoes a rapid rise in serum sodium is at risk for myelinolysis. Some individuals who are particularly vulnerable are those with chronic alcoholism and those who have had a liver transplant. Myelinolysis has occurred in individuals undergoing renal dialysis burn victims people with HIV-AIDS people over-using water loss pills diuretics and women with eating disorders such as anorexia or bulimia. The risk for CPM is greater if the serum blood sodium was low for at least 2 days before correction."

There are five types of neurosyphilis - asymptomatic neurosyphilis - meningeal neurosyphilis - meningovascular neurosyphilis - general paresis and - tabes dorsalis. Asymptomatic neurosyphilis means that neurosyphilis is present but the individual reports no symptoms and does not feel sick. Meningeal syphilis can occur between the first few weeks to the first few years of getting syphilis. Individuals with meningeal syphilis can have headache stiff neck nausea and vomiting. Sometimes there can also be loss of vision or hearing. Meningovascular syphilis causes the same symptoms as meningeal syphilis but affected individuals also have strokes. This form of neurosyphilis can occur within the first few months to several years after infection. General paresis can occur between 3 30 years after getting syphilis. People with general paresis can have personality or mood changes. Tabes dorsalis is characterized by pains in the limbs or abdomen failure of muscle coordination and bladder disturbances. Other signs include vision loss loss of reflexes and loss of sense of vibration poor gait and impaired balance. Tabes dorsalis can occur anywhere from 5 50 years after initial syphilis infection. General paresis and tabes dorsalis are now less common than the other forms of neurosyphilis because of advances made in prevention screening and treatment.

Polyomavirus JC often called JC virus is carried by a majority of people and is harmless except among those with lowered immune defenses. The disease is rare and occurs in patients undergoing chronic corticosteroid or immunosuppressive therapy for organ transplant or individuals with cancer such as Hodgkins disease or lymphoma. Individuals with autoimmune conditions such as multiple sclerosis rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosis -- some of whom are treated with biological therapies that allow JC virus reactivation -- are at risk for PML as well. PML is most common among individuals with HIV-1 infection  acquired immune deficiency syndrome AIDS. Studies estimate that prior to effective antiretroviral therapy as many as 5 percent of persons infected with HIV-1 eventually develop PML that is an AIDS-defining illness. However current HIV therapy using antiretroviral drugs ART which effectively restores immune system function allows as many as half of all HIV-PML patients to survive although they may sometimes have an inflammatory reaction in the regions of the brain affected by PML. The symptoms of PML are diverse since they are related to the location and amount of damage in the brain and may evolve over the course of several weeks to months The most prominent symptoms are clumsiness progressive weakness and visual speech and sometimes personality changes. The progression of deficits leads to life-threatening disability and frequently death. A diagnosis of PML can be made following brain biopsy or by combining observations of a progressive course of the disease consistent white matter lesions visible on a magnetic resonance imaging MRI scan and the detection of the JC virus in spinal fluid."

If the information is available the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients when available Intellectual disability 5 Autosomal dominant inheritance - Behavioral abnormality - Focal seizures - Incomplete penetrance - Juvenile onset - Seizures - The Human Phenotype Ontology HPO has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example a frequency of 2525 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes no information on frequency is available. In these cases the sign or symptom may be rare or common."

Unicentric CD is a localized condition that is generally confined to a single set of lymph nodes while multicentric CD is a systemic disease that affects multiple sets of lymph nodes and other tissues throughout the body. The exact underlying cause of CD is currently unknown however it is thought to occur sporadically in people with no family history of the condition. Treatment varies based on the form of the condition the severity of symptoms and whether or not the affected person also has an HIV andor human herpes virus type 8 HHV-8 infection.

However some scientists suspect that an increased production of interleukin-6 IL-6 by the immune system may contribute to the development of CD. IL-6 is a substance normally produced by cells within the lymph nodes that helps coordinate the immune response to infection. Increased production of IL-6 may result in an overgrowth of lymphatic cells leading to many of the signs and symptoms of CD. It has also been found that a virus called human herpes virus type 8 also known as HHV-8 Kaposi is sarcoma-associated herpesvirus or KSHV is present in many people with multicentric CD specifically. HHV-8 is found in nearly all people who are HIV-positive and develop multicentric CD and in up to 60 of affected people without HIV. The HHV-8 virus may possibly cause multicentric CD by making its own IL-6."

        "output": "How might cheilitis glandularis be treated The approach to treatment for cheilitis glandularis is typically based on information obtained from histopathologic analysis microscopic examination of the tissue the identification of the likely causes responsible for the condition and attempts to alleviate or eradicate those causes. Given the relatively small number of reported cases of the condition there is not sufficient or reliable data that exists with regard to medical approaches. Therefore treatment generally varies accordingly for each individual. For cases attributable to angioedema swelling similar to hives beneath the skin an antihistamine may help with temporary reduction of acute nonpurulent lacking pus swelling. Suppurative cases those with pus present typically require management with appropriate antimicrobial treatment as determined by culture and sensitivity testing. Concomitant corticosteroid treatment may increase the effectiveness of antimicrobial therapy in cases with nodularity however the potential adverse effects of long-term corticosteroid treatment and because it can promote local fibrosis and scarring limit its potential use either as an adjunct to antibiotic treatment or as a single therapeutic modality. Topical 5-fluorouracil is useful for treatment of dysplastic actinic cheilitis and to curtail its progression. In conjunction with clinical supervision it can be prescribed as an alternative to vermilionectomy sometimes called a lip shave or as a preventative measure following vermilionectomy. In cheilitis glandularis cases in which a history of chronic sun exposure exists especially if the individual is fair skinned or the everted lip surface is chronically eroded ulcerated or crusted biopsy is strongly recommended to rule out actinic cheilitis or carcinoma. Surgical excision is typically not necessary when the diagnosis is actinic cheilitis with atypia or only mild dysplasia however individuals require ongoing clinical vigilance at regular intervals and instruction in measures to protect the lips from further sun damage. Treatment options for cases of actinic cheilitis with moderate-to-severe dysplasia include surgical stripping or vermilionectomy cryosurgery or laser surgery or topical chemotherapy with 5-fluorouracil. Given the potential for recurrence and the risk for development of carcinoma sun protective measures and regular clinical monitoring should be instituted. In cases in which eversion extensive fibrosis and induration have resulted in lip incompetence with functional and cosmetic compromise chronic pain and surface disruption surgical cheiloplasty lip reduction may be indicated to restore normal lip architecture and function. Cheiloplasty is also a prophylactic measure for reducing the risk of actinic injury."

The severity duration and age of onset also vary. CSS is considered to have three distinct phases - prodromal allergic eosinophilic and vasculitic - which do not always occur sequentially. Some people do not develop all three phases. The prodromal or allergic phase is characterized by various allergic reactions. Affected people may develop asthma including a cough wheezing and shortness of breath hay fever allergic rhinitis andor repeated episodes of sinusitis. This phase can last from months to many years. Most people develop asthma-like symptoms before any other symptoms. The eosinophilic phase is characterized by accumulation of eosinophils a specific type of white blood cell in various tissues of the body - especially the lungs gastrointestinal tract and skin. The vasculitic phase is characterized by widespread inflammation of various blood vessels vasculitis. Chronic vasculitis can cause narrowing of blood vessels which can block or slow blood flow to organs. Inflamed blood vessels can also become thin and fragile potentially rupturing or develop a bulge aneurysm. People with CSS often develop nonspecific symptoms including fatigue fever weight loss night sweats abdominal pain andor joint and muscle pain. Neurological symptoms such as pain tingling or numbness are common and depend on the specific nerves involved. About half of affected people develop skin abnormalities due to accumulation of eosinophils in skin tissue. Symptoms of skin involvement may include purplish skin lesions a rash with hives andor small bumps especially on the elbows. Gastrointestinal involvement may cause various symptoms also. Heart problems may include inflammation of heart tissues and in severe cases heart failure. The kidneys can also become involved eventually causing glomerulonephritis.

Once attached, it enters the CD4 cells and uses it to make thousands of copies of itself. These copies then leave the CD4 cells, killing them in the process. This process continues until eventually the number of CD4 cells, also called your CD4 count, drops so low that your immune system stops working. This process may take up to 10 years, during which time you'll feel and appear well."
